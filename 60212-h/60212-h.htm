<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> title indicates that this volume is restricted to the
group of material conditions which constitute the organism
in relation to the physical world—a group which
furnishes the data for one half of the psychologist’s
quest; the other half being furnished by historical and
social conditions.</p>

<p>The Human Mind, so far as it is accessible to scientific
inquiry, has a twofold root, man being not only an animal
organism but an unit in the social organism; and hence
the complete theory of its functions and faculties must
be sought in this twofold direction. This conception
(which has been declared “to amount to a revolution in
Psychology”), although slowly prepared by the growing
conviction that Man could not be isolated from Humanity,
was first expounded in the opening volume of these
<i>Problems of Life and Mind</i>; at least, I am not aware
that any predecessor had seen <i>how</i> the specially human
faculties of Intellect and Conscience were products of
social factors co-operating with the animal factors.</p>

<p>In considering the Physical Basis a large place must
be assigned to the mechanical and chemical relations
which are involved in organic functions; yet we have to
recognize that this procedure of Analysis is artificial and
preparatory, that none of its results are final, none represent
the synthetic reality of <i>vital</i> facts. Hence one
leading object of the following pages has been everywhere
to substitute the biological point of view for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
metaphysical and mechanical points of view which too
often obstruct research—the one finding its expression
in spiritualist theories, the other in materialist theories;
both disregarding the plain principle that the first requisite
in a theory of biological phenomena must be to
view them in the light of biological conditions: in other
words, to fix our gaze upon what passes in the organism,
and not on what may pass in the laboratory, where the
conditions are different. Analysis is a potent instrument,
but is too often relied on in forgetfulness of what constitutes
its real aid, and thus leads to a disregard of all
those conditions which it has artificially set aside. We
see this in the tendency of anatomists and physiologists
to assign to <i>one</i> element, in a complex cluster of co-operants,
the significance which properly belongs to that
cluster: as when the property of a tissue is placed exclusively
in a single element of that tissue, the function
of an organ assigned to its chief tissue, and a function of
the organism to a single organ.</p>

<p>Another object has been to furnish the reader uninstructed
in physiology with such a general outline of the
structure and functions of the organism, and such details
respecting the sentient mechanism, as may awaken an
interest in the study, and enable him to understand the
application of Physiology to Psychology. If he comes
upon details which can only interest specially educated
students, or perhaps only by them be really understood,
he can pass over these details, for their omission will not
seriously affect the bearing of the general principles. I
have given the best I had to give; and must leave each
reader to find in it whatever may interest him. The uses
of books are first to stimulate inquiry by awakening an
interest; secondly, to clarify and classify the knowledge
already gained from direct contemplation of the phenomena.
They are stimuli and aids to observation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
thought. They should never be allowed to see for us,
nor to think for us.</p>

<p>The volume contains four essays. The first, on the
<i>Nature of Life</i>, deals with the speciality of organic phenomena,
as distinguished from the inorganic. It sets forth
the physiological principles which Psychology must incessantly
invoke. In the course of the exposition I have
incorporated several passages from four articles on Mr.
Darwin’s hypotheses, contributed to the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
during the year 1868. I have also suggested a
modification of the hypothesis of Natural Selection, by
extending to the <i>tissues and organs</i> that principle of competition
which Mr. Darwin has so luminously applied to
<i>organisms</i>. Should this generalization of the “struggle
for existence” be accepted, it will answer many of the
hitherto unanswerable objections.</p>

<p>The second essay is on the <i>Nervous Mechanism</i>, setting
forth what is known and what is inferred respecting the
structure and properties of that all-important system.
If the sceptical and revolutionary attitude, in presence of
opinions currently held to be established truths, surprises
or pains the reader unprepared for such doubts, I can only
ask him to submit my statements to a similar scepticism,
and confront them with the ascertained evidence. After
many years of laborious investigation and meditation, the
conclusion has slowly forced itself upon me, that on this
subject there is a “false persuasion of knowledge” very
fatal in its influence, because unhesitatingly adopted as
the ground of speculation both in Pathology and Psychology.
This persuasion is sustained because few are aware
how much of what passes for observation is in reality
sheer hypothesis. I have had to point out the great
extent to which Imaginary Anatomy has been unsuspectingly
accepted; and hope to have done something towards
raising a rational misgiving in the student’s mind respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
“the superstition of the nerve-cell”—a superstition
which I freely confess to have shared in for many years.</p>

<p>The third essay treats of <i>Animal Automatism</i>. Here
the constant insistance on the biological point of view,
while it causes a rejection of the mechanical theory, admits
the fullest recognition of all the mechanical relations
involved in animal movements, and thus endeavors to reconcile
the contending schools. In this essay I have also
attempted a psychological solution of that much-debated
question—the relation between Body and Mind. This
solution explains why physical and mental phenomena
must necessarily present to our apprehension such profoundly
diverse characters; and shows that Materialism,
in attempting to deduce the mental from the physical,
puts into the conclusion what the very terms have excluded
from the premises; whereas, on the hypothesis of a
physical process being only the objective aspect of a mental
process, the attempt to interpret the one by the other is
as legitimate as the solution of a geometrical problem by
algebra.</p>

<p>In the final essay the <i>Reflex Theory</i> is discussed; and
here once more the biological point of view rectifies the
error of an analysis which has led to the denial of Sensibility
in reflex actions, because that analysis has overlooked
the necessary presence of the conditions which
determine Sensibility. In these chapters are reproduced
several passages from the <i>Physiology of Common Life</i>.</p>

<p>According to my original intention, this volume was to
have included an exposition of the part I conceive the
brain to play in physiological and psychological processes,
but that must be postponed until it can be accompanied
by a survey of psychological processes which would render
the exposition more intelligible.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PROBLEM STATED.</span></h2>

<p>1. <span class="firstword">Although</span> for convenience we use the terms Life
and Mind as representing distinct orders of phenomena,
the one objective and the other subjective, and although
for centuries they have designated distinct entities, or
forces having different substrata, we may now consider it
sufficiently acknowledged among scientific thinkers that
every problem of Mind is necessarily a problem of Life,
referring to one special group of vital activities. It is
enough that Mind is never manifested except in a living
organism to make us seek in an analysis of organic phenomena
for the material conditions of every mental fact.
Mental phenomena when observed in others, although
interpretable by our consciousness of what is passing in
ourselves, can only be objective phenomena of the vital
organism.</p>

<p>2. On this ground, if on this alone, an acquaintance
with the general principles of structure and function is
indispensable to the psychologist; although only of late
years has this been fully recognized, so that men profoundly
ignorant of the organism have had no hesitation
in theorizing on its highest functions. In saying that such
knowledge is indispensable, I do not mean that in the
absence of such knowledge a man is debarred from understanding
much of the results reached by investigators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
nor that he may not himself make useful observations
and classifications of psychological facts. It is possible
to read books on Natural History with intelligence and
profit, and even to make good observations, without a
scientific groundwork of biological instruction; and it is
possible to arrive at empirical facts of hygiene and medical
treatment without any physiological instruction. But
in all three cases the absence of a scientific basis will render
the knowledge fragmentary and incomplete; and this
ought to deter every one from offering an opinion on debatable
questions which pass beyond the limit of subjective
observations. The psychologist who has not prepared
himself by a study of the organism has no more right to
be heard on the genesis of the psychical states, or of the
relations between body and mind, than one of the laity
has a right to be heard on a question of medical treatment.</p>

<h3 id="sec_1">THE POSITION OF BIOLOGY.</h3>

<p>3. Science is the systematic classification of Experience.
It postulates unity of Existence with great varieties
in the Modes of Existence; assuming that there is one
Matter everywhere the same, under great diversities in
the complications of its elements. The distinction of
Modes is not less indispensable than the identification of
the elements. These Modes range themselves under three
supreme heads: Force, Life, Mind. Under the first, range
the general properties exhibited by <i>all</i> substances; under
the second, the general properties exhibited by <i>organized</i>
substances; under the third, the general properties exhibited
by organized <i>animal</i> substances. The first class
is subdivided into <i>Physics</i>, celestial and terrestrial, and
<i>Chemistry</i>. Physics treats of substances which move as
masses, or which vibrate and rotate as molecules, without
undergoing any appreciable change of structural integrity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
they show changes of <i>position</i> and <i>state</i>, without corresponding
changes in their elements. Chemistry treats of
substances which undergo molecular changes of composition
<i>destructive</i> of their integrity. Thus the blow which
simply moves one body, or makes it vibrate, explodes
another. The friction which alters the temperature and
electrical state of a bit of glass, ignites a bit of phosphorus,
and so destroys its integrity of structure, converting
phosphorus into phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>4. The second class, while exhibiting both physical
and chemical properties, is markedly distinguished by the
addition of properties called vital. Their peculiarity consists
in this: they undergo molecular changes of composition
and decomposition which are simultaneous, and <i>by
this simultaneity preserve their integrity of structure</i>. They
change their state, and their elements, yet preserve their
unity, and even when differentiating continue specific.
Unlike all other bodies, the organized are born, grow, develop,
and decay, through a prescribed series of graduated
evolutions, each stage being the indispensable condition
of its successor, no stage ever appearing except in its
serial order.</p>

<p id="I_5">5. The third class, while exhibiting all the characteristics
of the two preceding classes, is specialized by the
addition of a totally new property, called Sensibility,
which subjectively is Feeling. Here organized substance
has become animal substance, and Vegetality has been
developed into Animality by the addition of new factors,—new
complexities of the elementary forces. Many, if
not most, philosophers postulate an entirely new Existence,
and not simply a new Mode, to account for the
manifestations of Mind; they refuse to acknowledge it
to be a vital manifestation, they demand that to Life be
added a separate substratum, the Soul. This is not a
point to be discussed here. We may be content with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
assertion that however great the phenomenal difference
between Humanity and Animality (a difference we shall
hereafter see to be the expression of a new factor, namely,
the social factor), nevertheless the distinctive attribute of
Sensibility, out of which rise Emotion and Cognition,
marks the inseparable <i>kinship</i> of mental with vital phenomena.</p>

<p>Thus all the various Modes of Existence may, at least
in their objective aspect, be ranged under the two divisions
of Inorganic and Organic,—Non-living and Living,—and
these are respectively the objects of the cosmological
and the biological sciences.</p>

<p>6. The various sciences in their serial development
develop the whole art of Method. Mathematics develops
abstraction, deduction, and definition; Astronomy
abstraction, deduction, and observation; Physics adds experiment;
Chemistry adds nomenclature; Biology adds
classification, and for the first time brings into prominence
the important notion of <i>conditions of existence</i>, and
the variation of phenomena under varying conditions: so
that the relation of the organism to its medium is one
never to be left out of sight. In Biology also clearly
emerges for the first time what I regard as the true notion
of causality, namely, the <i>procession</i> of causes,—the combination
of factors in the product, and not an <i>ab extra</i> determination
of the product. In Vitality and Sensibility
we are made aware that the causes are <i>in</i> and not <i>outside</i>
the organism; that the organic effect is the organic cause
in operation; that there is autonomy but no autocracy;
the effect issues as a resultant of the co-operating conditions.
In Sociology, finally, we see brought into prominence
the <i>historical conditions of existence</i>. From the due
appreciation of the conditions of existence, material and
historical, we seize the true significance of the principle
of Relativity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
7. Having thus indicated the series of the abstract
sciences we have now to consider more closely the character
of Biology. The term was proposed independently
yet simultaneously in Germany and France, in the year
1802, by Treviranus and Lamarck, to express “the study
of the forms and phenomena of Life, the conditions and
laws by which these exist, and the causes which produce
them.” Yet only of late years has it gained general acceptance
in France and England. The term Cosmology,
for what are usually called the Physical Sciences, has not
yet come into general use, although its appropriateness
must eventually secure its recognition.</p>

<p>Biology,—the abstract science of Life,—embracing
the whole organic world, includes Vegetality, Animality,
and Humanity; the biological sciences are Phytology,
Zoölogy, and Anthropology. Each of the sciences has its
cardinal divisions, statical and dynamical, namely, Morphology—the
science of form,—and Physiology—the
science of function.</p>

<p>Morphology embraces—1°, <i>Anatomy</i>, i. e. the description
of the parts then and there present in the organism;
and these parts, or organs, are further described by the
enumeration of their constituent tissues and elements;
and of these again the proximate principles, so far as they
can be isolated without chemical decomposition. 2°, <i>Organogeny</i>,
i. e. the history of the evolution of organs and
tissues.</p>

<p>Physiology embraces the properties and functions of
the tissues and organs—the primary conditions of Growth
and Development out of which rise the higher functions
bringing the organism into active relation with the surrounding
medium. The first group of properties and
functions are called those of vegetal, or organic life; the
second those of animal, or relative life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_2">ORGANISMS.</h3>

<p>8. It will be needful to fix with precision the terms,
Organism, Life, Property, and Function.</p>

<p>An organism, although usually signifying a more or less
complex unity of organs, because the structures which
first attracted scientific attention were all thus markedly
distinguished from inorganic bodies, has by the gradual
extensions of research been necessarily generalized, till it
now stands for any organized substance capable of independent
vitality: in other words, any substance having
the specific combination of elements which manifests the
serial phenomena of growth, development, and decay.
There are organisms that have no differentiated organs.
Thus a microscopic formless lump of semifluid jelly-like
substance (Protoplasm) is called an organism, because it
feeds itself, and reproduces itself. There are advantages
and disadvantages in such extensions of terms. These are
notable in the parallel extension of the term Life, which
originally expressing only the complex activities of complex
organisms, has come to express the simplest activities
of protoplasm. Thus a Monad is an organism; a Cell is
an organism; a Plant is an organism; a Man is an organism.
And each of these organisms is said to have its Life,
because</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Through all the mighty commonwealth of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the creeping worm to sovereign man”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">there is one fundamental group of conditions, one organized
substance, one vitality.</p>

<p>Obviously this unity is an abstraction. In reality, the
life manifested in the Man is <i>not</i> the life manifested in
the Monad: he has Functions and Faculties which the
Monad has no trace of; and if the two organisms have
certain vital characteristics in common, this unity is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
recognized in an <i>ideal construction</i> which lets drop all concrete
differences. The Life is different when the organism
is different. Hence any definition of Life would be manifestly
insufficient which while it expressed the activities
of the Monad left unexpressed the conspicuous and important
activities of higher organisms. A sundial and a
repeater will each record the successive positions of the
sun in the heavens; but although both are instruments
for marking time, the sundial will not do the work of the
repeater; the complexity and delicacy of the watch mechanism
are necessary for its more varied and delicate uses.
A semifluid bit of protoplasm will feed itself; but it will
not feed and sustain a complex animal; nor will it feel
and think.</p>

<p>9. Neglect of this point has caused frequent confusion
in the attempts to give satisfactory definitions. Biologists
ought to have been warned by the fact that some of the
most widely accepted definitions exclude the most conspicuous
phenomena of Life, and are only applicable to the
vegetable world, or to the vegetal processes in the animal
world. A definition, however abstract, should not exclude
essential characters. The general consent of mankind has
made Life synonymous with Mode of Existence. By the
life of an animal is meant the existence of that animal;
when dead the <i>animal</i> no longer exists; the substances
of which the organism was composed exist, but under
another mode; their connexus is altered, and the organism
vanishes in the alteration. It is a serious mistake to
call the corpse an organism; for that <i>special</i> combination
which constituted the organism is not present in the corpse.
This misconception misleads some speculative minds into
assigning life to the universe. The universe assuredly
exists, but it does not live; its existence can only be
identified with life, such as we observe in organisms, by
a complete obliteration of the speciality which the term<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Life is meant to designate. Yet many have not only
pleased themselves with such a conception, but have conceived
the universe to be an organism fashioned, directed,
and sustained by a soul like that of man—the <i>anima
mundi</i>. This is to violate all scientific canons. The life
of a plant-organism is not the same as the life of an
animal-organism; the life of an animal-organism is not
the same as the life of a human-organism; nor can the life
of a human-organism be the same as the life of the world-organism.
The unity of Existences does not obliterate
the variety of Modes; yet it is the speciality of each Mode
which Science investigates; to some of these Modes the
term Life is consistently applied, to others not; and if we
merge them all in a common term, we must then invent
a new term to designate the Modes now included under
Life.</p>

<p>10. In resisting this unwarrantable extension of the
term I am not only pointing to a speculative error, but
also to a serious biological error common in both spiritualist
and materialist schools, namely that of assigning
Life to other than organic agencies. Instead of recognizing
the speciality of this Mode of Existence as dependent
on a speciality of the organic conditions, the spiritualist
assigns Life to some extra-organic Vital Principle, the
materialist assigns it to some inorganic agent—physical
or chemical. Waiving for the present all discussion of
Vitalism, let us consider in what sense we must separate
organic from all inorganic phenomena.</p>

<p id="I_11">11. There is a distinction between inorganic and organic
which may fitly be called radical: it lies at the root of
the phenomena, and must be accepted as an ultimate fact,
although the synthesis on which it depends is analytically
reducible to a complication of more primitive conditions.
It has been already indicated in § <a href="#I_5">5</a>. All organisms above
the very simplest are syntheses Of three terms: Structure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Aliment, and Instrument. Crystals, like all other anorganisms
have structure, and in a certain sense they may
be said to grow (<i>Mineralia crescunt</i>), though the growth
is by <i>increase</i> and not by <i>modification</i>:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the motherlye,
which is the food of the crystal, is never brought to the
crystal, nor prepared for it, by any instrumental agency
of the crystal. Organisms are exclusively instrumental;
the organ is an instrument. The structural integrity of
an organism is thus preserved through an alimentation
which is effected through special instruments. Nothing
like this is visible in anorganisms.</p>

<p>The increase of a crystal is further distinguishable from
the growth of an organism, in the fact Of its being simple
accretion without development; and the structure of the
crystal is distinguishable from that of an organism in the
fact that its integrity is preserved by the <i>exclusion</i> of all
molecular change, and not by the simultaneous changes
of molecular decomposition and recomposition. Inorganic
substances are sometimes as unstable as organic,
sometimes even more unstable; but their instability is
the source of their structural destruction—they change
into other species; whereas the instability of <i>organized</i>
substances (<i>not</i> of organic) is the source of their structural
integrity: the tissue is renovated, and its renovation is a
consequence of its waste.</p>

<p>12. But while the distinction is thus radical, when we
view the organism from the <i>real</i>—that is, from the synthetic
point of view—we must also urge the validity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the analytical point of view, which seizes on the conditions
here complicated in a special group, and declares
these conditions to be severally recognizable equally in
anorganisms and in organisms. All the fundamental
properties of Matter are recognizable in organized Matter.
The elementary substances and forces familiar to physicists
and chemists are the materials of the biologist; nor
has there been found a single organic substance, however
special, that is not reducible to inorganic elements. We
see, then, that organized Matter is only a special combination
of that which in <i>other</i> combinations presents chemical
and physical phenomena; and we are prepared to find
Chemistry and Physics indispensable aids in our analysis
of organic phenomena. Aids, but only aids; indispensable,
but insufficient.</p>

<p>13. There is therefore an ambiguity in the common
statement that organized matter is not <i>ordinary</i> matter.
Indisputable in one sense, this is eminently disputable
when it is interpreted as evidence of a peculiar Vital Force
“wholly unallied with the primary energy of Motion.”
If by “ordinary matter” be meant earths, crystals, gases,
vapors, then assuredly organized matter is not ordinary.
“Between the <i>living</i> state of matter and its <i>non-living</i>
state,” says Dr. Beale, “there is an absolute and irreconcilable
difference; so far from our being able to demonstrate
that the non-living passes by gradations into or gradually
assumes the scale or condition of the <i>living</i>, the transition
is sudden and abrupt, and matter already in the living
state may pass into the non-living condition in the same
sudden and complete manner.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The ambiguity here is
sensible in the parallel case of the difference between
crystallizable and coagulable matter, or between one crystal
and another. If we can decompose the organic into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the inorganic, this shows that the elements of the one
are elements of the other; and if we are not yet able
to recompose the inorganic elements into organic matter
(not at least in its more complex forms), may this not be
due to the fact that we are ignorant of the proximate
synthesis, ignorant of the precise way in which the elements
are combined? I may have every individual part
of a machine before me, but unless I know the proper
position of each, I cannot with the parts reconstruct the
machine. Indeed the very common argument on which
so much stress is laid in favor of some mysterious Principle
as the source of organic phenomena, namely, that
human skill is hopelessly baffled in the attempt to make
organic substances, still more a living cell, is futile. Men
can make machines, it is said, but not organisms, <i>ergo</i>
organisms must have a spiritual origin. But the fact is
that no man can make a machine, <i>unless</i> he take advantage
of the immense traditions of our race, and apply the
skill of millions who have worked and thought before him,
slowly and tentatively discovering the necessary means
of mechanical effect. The greatest thinker, or the deepest
scholar, who did not place himself in the line of the tradition,
and learn the principles of mechanism, and the
properties of the materials, would be as incapable of making
a watch, as the physiologist now is of making a cell.
But the skill of man has already succeeded in making
many organic substances, and will perhaps eventually
succeed in making a cell, certainly will, if ever the special
synthesis which binds the elements together should be
discovered. Not that such a discovery would alter the
position of Biology in relation to Chemistry. The making
of albumen, nay, the construction of an organism in the
laboratory, would not in the least affect the foundation of
Biology, would not obliterate the radical difference between
organisms and anorganisms. It is the speciality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
organic phenomena which gives them a special place,
although the speciality may only be due to a complication
of general agencies.</p>

<h3 id="sec_3">VITAL FORCE.</h3>

<p id="I_14">14. A similar ambiguity to that of the phrase “ordinary
matter” lies in the equally common phrase “Vital Force,”
which is used to designate a special group of agencies,
and is then made to designate an agent which has no
kinship with the general group; that is to say, instead of
being employed in its real signification—that which alone
represents our knowledge—as the abstract statical expression
of the complex conditions necessary to the manifestation
of vital phenomena, or as the abstract dynamical
expression of the phenomena themselves, it is employed
as an expression of their unknown Cause, which, because
unknown, is dissociated from the known conditions, and
erected into a mysterious Principle, having no kinship
with Matter. In the first sense the term is a shorthand
symbol of what is known and inferred. The known conditions
are the relations of an organism and its medium,
the organism being the union of various substances all
of which have their peculiar properties when isolated;
properties that disappear in the union, and are replaced
by others, which result from the combination—as the
properties of chlorine and sodium all disappear in the
sea-salt which results from their union; or as the properties
of oxygen and the properties of hydrogen disappear
and are replaced by the properties of water. When therefore
Vital Force is said to be exalted or depressed, the
phrase has rational interpretation in the alteration which
has taken place in one or more of the conditions, internal
and external: a change in the tissues, the plasma, or the
environment, exalts or depresses the energy of the vital
manifestations; and to suppose that this is effected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
through the agency of some extra-organic Principle is a
purely gratuitous fiction.</p>

<p>15. That we are ignorant of one or more of the indispensable
conditions symbolized in the abstract term Vitality
or Vital Force, is no reason for quitting the secure
though difficult path of Observation, and rushing into
the facile but delusive path of Fiction, which proposes
metempirical Agents (in the shape of Vital and Psychical
Principles) to solve the problems of Life and Mind. We
may employ the term Vital Force to label our observations,
together with all that still remains unobserved;
and we are bound to recognize the line which separates
observation from inference, what is proved from what is
inferred; but while marking the limits of the known,
we are not to displace the known in favor of the unknown.
It is said that because of our ignorance we must
assume these causes of Life and Mind to be <i>unallied</i> with
known material causes, and belonging to a different order
of existences. This is to convert ignorance into a proof;
and not only so, but to allow what we do not know to displace
what we do know. The organicist is ready to admit
that much has still to be discovered; the vitalist, taking
his stand upon this unknown, denies that what has been
discovered is really important, and declares that the real
agent is wholly unallied to it. How <i>can</i> he know this?</p>

<p>He does not know it; he assumes it; and the chief
evidence he adduces is that the ordinary laws of inorganic
matter are incapable of explaining the phenomena of organized
matter; and that physical and chemical forces are
controlled by vital force. I accept both these positions,
stripping them, however, of their ambiguities. The laws
of ordinary matter are clearly incompetent in the case of
matter which is not ordinary, but <i>specialized</i> in organisms;
and when we come to treat of Materialism we shall see
how unscientific have been the hypotheses which disregard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the distinction. The question of control is too interesting
and important to be passed over here.</p>

<h3 id="sec_4">VITAL FORCE CONTROLLING PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL FORCES.</h3>

<p>16. The facts relied on by the vitalists are facts which
every organicist will emphasize, though he will interpret
them differently. When, for example, it is said that
“Life resists the effect of mechanical friction,” and the
proof adduced is the fact that the friction which will thin
and wear away a dead body is actually the cause of the
thickening of a living—the skin of a laborer’s hand being
thickened by his labor; the explanation is not that Life,
an extra-organic agent, “resists mechanical friction”—for
the mechanical effect is <i>not</i> resisted (the skin is rubbed
off the rower’s hand sooner than the wood is rubbed off
the oar)—but that Life, i. e. organic activity repairs the
waste of tissue.</p>

<p>17. Again, although many of the physical and chemical
processes which invariably take place under the influences
to which the substances are subjected out of the organism,
will not take place at all, or will take place in different
degrees, when the substances are in the organism, this is
important as an argument against the notion of vital
<i>phenomena</i> being deducible from physical and chemical
<i>laws</i>, but is valueless as evidence in favor of an extra-organic
agent. Let us glance at one or two striking examples.</p>

<p>18. No experimental inquirer can have failed to observe
the often contradictory results which seemingly unimportant
variations in the conditions bring about; no one can
have failed to observe what are called chemical affinities
wholly frustrated by vital conditions. Even the ordinary
laws of Diffusion are not always followed in the organism.
The Amœba, though semifluid, resists diffusion when alive;
but when it dies it swells and bursts by osmosis. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
exchange of gases does not take place in the tissues, precisely
as in our retorts. The <i>living</i> muscle respires, that
is, takes up oxygen and gives out carbonic acid, not on
the principle of simple diffusion, but by two separable
physiological processes. The carbonic acid is given out,
even when there is no oxygen whatever present in the
atmosphere, and its place may then be supplied by hydrogen;
and this physiological process is so different from
the physical process which goes on in the dead muscle
(the result of putrefaction), that it has been proved by
Ranke to go on when the temperature is so low that all
putrefaction is arrested. The same experimenter finds<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
that whereas living nerve will take up, by imbibition, 10
per cent of potash salts, it will not take up 1 per cent of
soda salts, presented in equal concentration; and he points
to the general fact that the absorption of inorganic substances
does <i>not</i> take place according to the simple laws
of diffusion, but that living tissues have special laws, the
nerve, for instance, having a greater affinity for neutral
potash salts than for neutral soda salts. Let me add, by
way of anticipating the probable argument that may urge
this in favor of Vital Principle which is lightly credited
with the prescience of final causes, that so far from this
“elective affinity” of the tissues being intelligent and
always favorable, Ranke’s experiments unequivocally show
that it is more active towards destructive, poisonous substances,
than towards the reparative, alimentary substances;
which is indeed consistent with the familiar experience
that poisons are more readily absorbed than foods, when
both are brought to the tissues. Thus it is well known
that of all the salts the sulphate of copper is that which
plants most readily absorb—and it kills them. The special
affinities disappear as the vitality disappears, and
dying plants absorb all salts equally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
19. The more the organism is studied, the more evident
it will become that the simple laws of diffusion, as presented
in anorganisms rarely if ever take effect in tissues;
in other words, what is called Imbibition in Physics is
the somewhat different process of Absorption in Physiology.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
The difference is notable in this capital fact, that
whereas the physical diffusion of liquids and gases is
determined by differences of density, the physiological
absorption of liquids and gases is determined by the molecular
organization of the tissue, which is perfectly indifferent
to, and resists the entrance of, all substances incapable
of entering into organic combination, either as aliment
or poison. A curious example of the indifference of organized
substances to some external influences and their
reaction upon others, is the impossibility of provoking
ciliary movement in an epithelial cell, during repose, by
any electrical, mechanical, or chemical stimuli except potash
and soda. Virchow discovered that a minute quantity
of either of these, added to the water in which the
cell floated, at once called forth the ciliary movements.</p>

<p id="I_20">20. The true meaning of the resistance of Vitality to
ordinary chemical affinity is, that the conditions involved
in the phenomena of Vitality are not the conditions involved
in the phenomena of Chemistry; in other words,
that in the living organism the substances are placed
under conditions different from those in which we observe
these substances when their chemical affinities are displayed
in anorganisms. But we need not go beyond the
laboratory to see abundant examples of this so-called resistance
to chemical affinity, when the conditions are
altered. The decomposition of carbonates by tartaric acid
is a chemical process which is wholly resisted if alcohol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
instead of water be the solvent employed. The union of
sulphur with lead is said to be due to the affinity of the
one for the other; but no one supposes this affinity to
be irrespective of conditions, or that the union will take
place when any one of these conditions is absent. If we
fuse a compound of lead and iron in a crucible containing
sulphur, we find it is the iron, and not the lead, which
unites with the sulphur; yet we do not conclude that
there is a Crucible Principle which frustrates chemical
affinity and resists the union of sulphur and lead; we
simply conclude that the presence of the iron is a condition
which prevents the combination of the sulphur with
the lead: not until all the iron has taken up its definite
proportion of sulphur will the affinity of the lead come
into play. This is but another illustration of the law that
<i>effects are processions of their causes</i>, summations of the
conditions of their existence. If the fire burns no hole in
the teakettle so long as there is water to conduct the heat
away, this is not due to any principle more mysterious
than the presence of a readily conducting water.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
21. In accordance with the law of Causation just mentioned,
which has been expounded in detail in our First
Series (Vol. II. p. 335), the special combinations of Matter
in organisms must present special phenomena. Therefore
since the province of Biology is that of explaining organic
phenomena by means of their organic conditions, it
must be radically distinguished from the provinces of
Physics and Chemistry, which treat not of organized but
of inorganic matter. It is idle, it is worse, for it is misleading,
to personify the organic conditions, known and
inferred, in a Vital Principle; idle, because we might with
equal propriety personify the conditions of crystallization
in a Crystal Principle; misleading, because the artifice is
quickly dropped out of sight, and the abstract term then
becomes accepted as an entity, supposed to create or rule
the phenomena it was invented to express.</p>

<p id="I_22">22. Inquirers are but too apt to misconceive the value
of Analysis, which is an artifice of Method indispensable
to research, though needing the complementary rectification
by Synthesis before a real explanation can be reached.
Analysis decomposes the actual fact into ideal factors,
separates the group into its components, and considers
each of these, not as it exists in the group, in the reality,
but as it exists when theoretically detached from the
others. The oxygen and hydrogen into which water is
decomposed did not exist as these gases in the water; the
albumen and phosphate we extract from a nerve did not
exist <i>as</i> isolated albumen and phosphate in the nerve, they
were molecularly combined. In like manner the physical
and chemical processes which may analytically be inferred
in vital processes do not really take place in the same way
as out of the organism. The real process is always a vital
process, and must be explained by the synthesis of all the
co-operant conditions. The laws of Physics and Chemistry
formulate abstract expressions of phenomena, wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and whenever these appear, without reference to the
<i>modes of production</i>; and in <i>this</i> sense the movement of
a limb is no less a case of Dynamics than the movement
of a pulley—the decomposition of a tissue is a case of
Chemistry no less than the decomposition of a carbonate;
the electromotor phenomena observed in muscle are as
purely physical as those observed in a telegraph. But
when a biologist has to explain the movements of the
limbs, or the decompositions of tissues, he has to deal with
the phenomena and their modes of production, he has a
particular group before him, and must leave out nothing
that is characteristic of it. The movements of the
pulley do not depend on Contractility and Sensibility,
which in turn depend on Nutrition. The decomposition
of the carbonate does not depend on conditions resembling
those of a living tissue. Vaucanson’s duck was surprisingly
like a living duck in many of its movements;
but in none of its actions was there any real similarity to
the actions of a bird, because the machine was unlike an
organism in action. The antithesis of mechanism and
organism will be treated of in § <a href="#I_78">78</a>.</p>

<p>23. We conclude, then, that defining physical phenomena
as the movements which take place <i>without</i> change
of structure, and chemical phenomena as the movements
<i>with</i> change of structure, although both classes may be
said to take place in the organism, and to be the primary
conditions on which organic phenomena depend, they do
not embrace the whole of the conditions, nor are the sciences
which formulate them capable of formulating either
the special phenomena characteristic of organisms or their
special modes of production. The biologist will employ
chemical and physical analysis as an essential part of his
method; but he will always rectify what is artificial in
this procedure, by subordinating the laws of Physics and
Chemistry to the laws of Biology revealed in the synthetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
observation of the organism as a whole. The rectification,
here insisted on, will be recognized as peculiarly
urgent in Psychology, which has greatly suffered from the
misdirection of Analysis.</p>

<p>24. No one will misunderstand this specialization of
Biology to mean a separation of Life from the series
of objective phenomena, and the introduction of a new
entity; the specialization points to a Mode of Existence.
All classifications are artifices, but they have their objective
grounds; the ground of difference on which Biology
is separated from Chemistry and Physics, though all
three may be merged in a common identity, is such as to
justify the term radical. A vital process is no more to
be considered physico-chemical, because physico-chemical
conditions are presupposed in it, than a feeling is to be
considered a nutritive process, because Nutrition is presupposed
in all Feeling. Organic substances have been
made by chemists, and inorganic “cells” have also been
made; but these substances were not organized, these
“cells” would not live. The germ-cell is the workshop
of generation, the secreting-cell the workshop of secretion,
the muscle-cell the workshop of contraction. What
is required over and above organic substances and cell-forms,
is that special state called <i>organization</i>. See § <a href="#I_49">49</a>.</p>

<p>Those who contemplate the manifestations without also
taking into account their modes of production may see
nothing but physico-chemical facts in vital facts. It is
by a similar limitation of the point of view that Vitality
is often confounded with Movement, and portions of
organic matter are said to live, simply on the evidence
of their movements.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<span class="subhead">DEFINITIONS OF LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>25. <span class="firstword">Biology,</span> the science of Life, being thus assigned
its place in the hierarchy of objective laws, we now proceed
to consider what the term Life symbolizes.</p>

<p>By a large preliminary simplification, Life may be defined
as <i>the mode of existence of an organism in relation
to its medium</i>. To render this of any value, however, a
clear conception of the organism is first indispensable;
and this must be preceded by an examination of the various
attempts to define life in anticipation of such a clear
conception.</p>

<p>26. Every phenomenon, or group of phenomena, may be
viewed under two aspects—the <i>statical</i>, which considers
the conditions of existence; and the <i>dynamical</i>, which considers
these conditions in their resultant,—in their <i>action</i>.
The statical definition of Life will express the connexus
of the properties of organized substance, all those conditions,
of matter, form, and texture, and of relation to
external forces, on which the organism depends. These
various conditions, condensed into a single symbol, constitute
Vitality or Vital Force, and are hence taken as the
Cause of vital phenomena. The dynamical definition
will express the connexus of Functions and Faculties of
the organism, which are the statical properties of organized
substance in action, under definite relations.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the term Life must vary with the
varying significates it condenses,—every variation in the
complexity of the organism will bring a corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
fulness in the signification of the term. The life of a
plant is less significant than the life of an animal; and
the life of a mollusc less than that of a fish. But not
only is the term one of varying significance, it is always
an abstract term which drops out of sight particular concrete
differences, registering only the universal resemblances.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>27. It would be a profitless labor to search out, and a
wearisome infliction to set down, the various definitions
which have been proposed and accepted; but certain
characteristic examples may be selected. All that I am
acquainted with belong to two classes: 1°, the <i>meta</i>-physiological
hypothesis of an <i>extra</i>-organic agent, animating
lifeless matter by unknown powers; 2°, the physiological
hypothesis which seeks the cause of the phenomena (i. e.
the conditions) <i>within</i> the organism itself,—a group of
conditions akin to those manifested elsewhere, but differently
combined. The first hypotheses are known under
the names of Animism and Vitalism,—more commonly
the latter. The second are known as Organicism and
Materialism,—but the latter term only applies to some
of the definitions.</p>

<p>28. Under Vitalism are included all the hypotheses of
a soul, a spirit, an archæus, a vital principle, a vital force,
a <i>nisus formativus</i>, a plan or divine idea, which have from
time to time represented the metaphysical stage of Biology.
The characteristic of that stage is the personification
of a mystery, accompanied by the persuasion that
to name a mystery is to explain it. In all sciences when
processes are imperfectly observed, the <i>theory</i> of the processes
(which is a systematic survey of the available evidence
marshalled in the order of causal dependence) is
supplemented by <i>hypothesis</i>, which fills up with a guess
the gap left by observation. The difference between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
metaphysical and the positive stages of a science lies in
the kind of guess thus introduced to supplement theory,
and the degree of reliance accorded to it. I have more
than once insisted on the scientific canon that “to be
valid, an explanation must be expressed in terms of
phenomena already observed”; now it is quite clear that
most of the extra-organic hypotheses do not fulfil this condition;
no one having ever <i>observed</i> a spirit, an archæus,
or a vital principle; but only <i>imagined</i> these agents to
explain the facts observed. As an example of the difference,
and a proof that the value of an hypothesis does
not rest on the facility with which it connects observations,
and seems to explain them, take the three hypotheses
of animal spirits, nervous fluid, and electricity, by
which neural processes have been explained. The animal
spirits are imaginary; the nervous fluid is without a
basis in observation, no evidence of such a fluid having
been detected; but electricity (or, speaking rigorously, the
movements classed as electrical), although not proved to
be <i>the</i> agent in nerve-action, is proved to exist in nerves
as elsewhere, and its modes of operation are verifiable.
It, therefore, and it alone of the three hypotheses, is in
conformity with the scientific canon. It may not, on full
investigation, meet all requirements; it may be rejected
as imperfect; but it is the kind of guess which scientific
theory demands.</p>

<p>The second difference noticeable between the metaphysical
and the positive stages is the degree of reliance
accorded to hypothesis; which is very much the same as
that noticeable in the uncritical and critical attitudes of
untrained and trained intellects. The one accepts a guess
as if it were a proof; is fascinated by the facility of linking
together isolated observations, and, relying on the
guess as truth, proceeds to deduce conclusions from it;
the other accepts a guess as an aid in research, trying by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
its aid to come upon some observation which will reveal
the hidden process; but careful never to allow the guess
to <i>supersede observation</i>, or to form a basis of deductions
not immediately verified.</p>

<p>29. A glance at the metaphysiological definitions will
detect both the kind of guess and the kind of reliance
which prevailed. The mystery was not simply recognized,
it was personified as an entity: Will and Intelligence
were liberally accorded to it, for it was supposed to
shape matter, and direct force into predestined paths by
prescience of a distant end. The observed facts of the
egg passing through successive changes into a complex
organism were so marvellous, so unlike any facts observable
in the inorganic world, that they seemed to demand
a cause drawn from higher sources. The mystery of life
obtruded itself at every turn. It was named, and men
fancied it explained. But in truth no mystery is got rid
of by explanation, however valid; it is only shifted farther
back. Explanation is the resolution of a complex phenomenon
into its conditions of existence—the product
is reduced to its factors; the explanation is final when
this resolution has been so complete that a reconstruction
of the product is possible from the factors. The vast majority
of explanations—especially in the organic region—are
no more than what mathematicians call “a first
approximation.” It is through successive approximations
that science advances; but even when the final stage is
reached a mystery remains. We may know that certain
elements combine in certain proportions to produce certain
substances; but why they produce these, and not
different substances, is no clearer than why muscles contract
or organisms die. This Why is, however, an idle
question. That alone which truly concerns us is the How,
and not the Why.</p>

<p>30. Biology is still a long way off the How. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
can boast of many approximations; and its theories are
to be tested by the degree of approximation they effect.
In this light the physiological, <i>intra</i>-organic, hypotheses
manifestly have the advantage. Many of them are indeed
very unacceptable; they are guided by a mistaken
conception of the truths reached by Analysis. For when
men first began to discard the extra-organic hypotheses,
and to look into the organism itself, they were so much
impressed by the mechanical facts observed, that they
endeavored to reduce all the phenomena to Mechanics.
The circulation became simply a question of hydraulics.
Digestion was explained as trituration. The chemists
then appeared, and their shibboleths were “affinities”
and “oxidations.” With Bichat arose the anatomical
school, which decomposing the organism into organs, the
organs into tissues, and these tissues into their elements,
sought the analytical conditions of existence of the organism
in the properties of these tissues, and the functions
of these organs. The extra-organic agent was thus finally
shown to be not only a fiction, but a needless fiction.</p>

<p>Every student of the history of the science will note
how from the very necessities of the case the metaphysiologists,
without relinquishing their Vital Principle, have
been led more and more to enter on the track of the
physiologists, pursuing their researches more and more
into the processes going on in the organism, and assigning
more and more causal efficiency to these, with a corresponding
restriction of the province of their extra-organic
cause. Hence in the ranks of the vitalists have been
found some of the very best observers and theorists; but
they were such in despite of, and not in consequence of,
their hypothesis, which was only invoked by them when
evidence was at fault. Nor, unscientific as vitalism is,
can we deny that it has been so far serviceable to the
science, that it has corrected the materialist error of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
endeavoring to explain organic phenomena by physico-chemical
laws; and has persistently kept in view the
radical difference between organic and inorganic.</p>

<p>31. These remarks may justify a selection of definitions,
classified under the two heads. The selection is fitly
opened by the Aristotelian definition which prevailed for
centuries.</p>

<p>Aristotle distinguishes Life, which he says means “the
faculties of self-nourishment, self-development, and self-decay,”
from the Vital Principle. Every natural body
manifesting life may be regarded as an essential existence
(οὐσία); but <i>then it is an existence only as a synthesis</i> (ὡς συθέτη);
and since an organism is such a synthesis, being
possessed of Life, it cannot be the Vital Principle (ψυχή).
Therefore it follows that the Vital Principle must be an
essence, as being the Form of a natural body holding life
in <i>potentiality</i>. The Vital Principle is the primary reality
of an organism. “It is therefore as idle to ask whether
the Vital Principle and Organism are one, as whether the
wax and the impress on it are one.... Thus if an eye
were an animal, Vision would be its Vital Principle: for
Vision is, abstractedly considered, the essence of the eye;
but the eye is the body of Vision, and if Vision be wanting,
then, save in name, it is no longer an eye.”</p>

<p>Apart from certain metaphysical implications, inevitable
at that period, there is profound insight in this passage.
His adversary Telesio quite misconceives the meaning
here assigned to the Vital Principle.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>32. Let us pass over all the intermediate forms of the
hypothesis, and descend to Kant, who defines Life “an
internal principle of action” (this does not distinguish it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
from fermentation); an organism he says is “that in
which every part is at once means and end.” “Each part
of the living body has its cause of existence in the whole
organism; whereas in non-living bodies each part has its
cause in itself.” Johannes Müller adopts a similar view:
“The harmonious action of the essential parts of the individual
subsist only by the influence of a force, the operation
of which is extended to all parts of the body, and
does not depend on any single parts; this <i>force must exist
before the parts</i>, which are in fact formed by it during the
development of the embryo.... The vital force inherent
in them generates from the organic matter the essential
organs which constitute the whole being. This <i>rational
creative force</i> is exerted in every animal strictly in accordance
with what the nature of each requires.”</p>

<p>33. This is decidedly inferior to Aristotle, who did not
confound the vegetative with the rational principle. It
rests on the old metaphysical error of a <i>vis medicatrix</i>, an
error which cannot sustain itself against the striking facts
which constantly point to a <i>vis destructrix</i>, a destructive
tendency quite as inexorable as the curative tendency.
And the experimental biologist soon becomes impressed
with the fact that the tissues have indeed a <i>selective</i> action,
by which from out the nutrient material only these substances
are assimilated which will enter into combination
with them; but this selective action is fatal, no less than
reparative: substances which poison the tissue are taken
up as readily as those which nourish it. The idea of
prescience, therefore, cannot be sustained; it is indeed
seldom met with now in the writings of any but the
Montpellier school, who continue the traditions of Stahl’s
teaching. It has been so long exploded elsewhere that
one is surprised to find an English physiologist clinging
to a modification of it—I mean Dr. Lionel Beale, who
repeatedly insists on Life as “a peculiar Force, <i>temporarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
associated</i> with matter,” a “power capable of controlling
and directing both matter and force,” an “<i>undiscovered</i>
form of force <i>having no connection with primary
energy or motion</i>.” “The higher phenomena of the nervous
system are probably due primarily to the movements
of the germinal matter due to vital power, which vital
power of this the highest form of germinal matter is in
fact the living <i>I</i>.”</p>

<p id="I_34">34. Apart from the primary objection to all these
definitions, namely, that they seek to express organic
phenomena in terms of an extra-organic principle, to
formulate the facts <i>observed</i> in terms of a cause <i>inferred</i>,
there is the fatal objection that they speak confidently
on what is avowedly unknown. If the force be, as Dr.
Beale says, “undiscovered,” on what grounds can he
assert that it has <i>no</i> connection with the forces which
are known? All that the observed facts warrant is the
assertion that organic phenomena are special (which no
one denies), and must therefore depend on special combinations
of matter and force. But on this ground we
might assume a crystallizing Force, and a coagulating
Force, having no connection with the molecular forces
manifested elsewhere: these also are special phenomena,
not to be confounded with each other.</p>

<p>35. Schelling defines Life as “a principle of individuation”
and a “cycle of successive changes determined and
fixed by this internal principle.” Which is so vague
that it may be applied in very different senses. Bichat’s
celebrated definition (which is only a paraphrase of a
sentence in Stahl), “the sum of the functions which resist
Death,” although an endeavor to express the facts
from the Intra-organic point of view, is not only vague,
but misrepresents one of the cardinal conditions, by treating
the External Medium as antagonistic to Life, whereas
Life is only possible in the relation to a Medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
36. Were it not so vague, the definition proposed by
Dugès and Béclard would be unexceptionable: the former
says it is “the special activity of organized beings”;
the latter, “the sum of the phenomena proper to organized
bodies.” When supplemented by a description of
organized bodies, these formulæ are compendious and
exact. The same remark applies to the definition of
Lamarck: “that state of things which permits organic
movements; and these movements, which constitute active
life, result from a stimulus which excites them.”</p>

<p>37. De Blainville, and after him Comte and Charles
Robin, define it thus: “Life is the twofold internal movement
of composition and decomposition at once general
and continuous.” This, excellent as regards what is
called vegetal life, is very properly objected to by Mr.
Herbert Spencer in that it excludes those nervous and
muscular functions which are the most conspicuous and
distinctive of vital phenomena. The same objection must
be urged against Professor Owen’s definition: “Life is a
centre of intussusceptive assimilative force capable of
reproduction by spontaneous fission.”</p>

<p>38. In 1853, after reviewing the various attempts to
express in a sentence what a volume could only approximately
expound, I proposed the following: “Life is a series
of definite and successive changes, both of structure
and composition, which take place within an individual
without destroying its identity.” This has been criticised
by Mr. Herbert Spencer and by Dr. Lionel Beale, and if
I had not withdrawn it before their criticisms appeared,
I should certainly have modified and enlarged it afterwards.
I mention it, however, because it is an approach
to a more satisfactory formula in so far as it specifies two
cardinal characteristics distinguishing organisms from all
anorganisms, namely, the incessant evolution through
definite stages, and the preservation of specific integrity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
throughout the changes; not only the organism as a
whole is preserved amidst incessant molecular change,
but each tissue lives only so long as the reciprocal molecular
composition and decomposition persist. On both of
these points I shall have to speak hereafter. The definition,
however, is not only defective in its restriction to
the molecular changes of Nutrition, taking no account of
the Properties and Functions of the organism; but defective
also in giving no expression to equally important
relations of the organism to the medium.</p>

<p>39. This last point is distinctly expressed in Mr. Spencer’s
definition: “Life is the continuous adjustment of
internal relations to external relations.” Considered as a
formula of the most general significance, embracing therefore
what is common to all orders of vital phenomena,
this is the best yet proposed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> If I propose another it
will not be to displace but to run alongside with Mr.
Spencer’s; and this only for more ready convenience.
Before doing so I must say a few words by way of clearing
the ground.</p>

<p>40. What does the term Life stand for? What are
the concrete significates of this abstract symbol? As
before stated, it is sometimes a compendious shorthand
for the special phenomena distinguishing living from non-living
bodies; and sometimes it expresses not these observed
phenomena, but their conditions of existence, which
are by one school personified in an abstract and extra-organic
cause. Thus the life of an animal, a man, or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
nation, means—1°, the special manifestations of these
organisms, and groups of organisms; or 2°, the causes
which produce these manifestations. We are often misunderstood
by others, and sometimes vague to ourselves,
when we do not bear these two different meanings in
view. It was probably some sense of this which made
Aristotle distinguish Vitality from Life, as that of the
one uniform cause separated from its multiple effects;
it was certainly the motive of Fletcher, who thus expressly
limits the meanings: “<i>Vitality</i> or <i>Irritability</i>, the
property which characterizes organized beings of being
acted on by certain powers otherwise than either strictly
mechanically or strictly chemically; <i>Life</i>, the sum of the
actions of organized beings resulting directly from their
vitality so acted on.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Vitality and Life being thus discriminated as the statical
and the dynamical aspects of the organism, we find
in relation to the former two radically opposed conceptions:
the metaphysiological or extra-organic, and the
physiological or intra-organic. The first conceives Vitality
to be a Vital Principle, or extra-organic agent,
sometimes a soul, spirit, archæus, idea, and sometimes a
force, which easily becomes translated into a property.</p>

<p>The conception of an entity must be rejected, because
it is metempirical and unverifiable, § <a href="#I_34">34</a>. The conception
of a force must be rejected, because it is irreconcilable
with any definite idea we have of force. What
the term Force signifies in Physics and Chemistry, namely,
mass animated by velocity, or <i>directed pressure</i>, which
is the activity of the agent,—is precisely that which
these vitalists pertinaciously exclude. They assume a
force which has nothing in common with mass and velocity;
which is <i>not a resultant, but a principle</i>; which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
instead of being a <i>directed quantity</i>, is itself autonomous
and <i>directive</i>, shaping matter into organization, and endowing
it with powers not assignable to matter. If this
vital force has any mass at its back, it is a spiritual
mass; if it is directed, the direction issues from a “Mind
somewhere.” Now this conception is purely metempirical.
Not only is it inexact to speak of Vitality as a
force, it is almost equally inexact to speak of it as a
property; since it is a term which includes a variety of
properties; and when Fletcher assigns the synonym of
Irritability, this at once reveals the inexactness; for
beside this property, we must place Assimilation, Evolution,
Disintegration, Reproduction, Contractility, and
Sensibility,—all characteristic properties included in Vitality.</p>

<p>41. Having thus rejected the conceptions of entity,
force, and property, we are left in presence of—1°, the
organic conditions as the elements, and 2°, of their synthesis
(in the state called organization) as the personified
principle. Vital forces, or the vital force, if we adopt
the term for brevity’s sake, is a <i>symbol of the conditions
of existence of organized matter</i>; and since organisms are
specially distinguishable from anorganisms by this speciality
of their synthesis, and not by any difference in
the nature of the elements combined, this state of organization
is the “force” or “principle” of which we are in
quest. To determine what Life means, we must observe
and classify the phenomena presented by living beings.
To determine what Vitality—or organization—means,
we must observe and classify the processes which go on
in organized substances. These will occupy us in the
succeeding chapters; here I may so far anticipate as to
propose the following <span class="locked">definitions:—</span></p>

<p id="I_42">42. Life is the functional activity of an organism in
relation to its medium, as a synthesis of three terms:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Structure, Aliment, and Instrument; it is the sum of
functions which are the resultants of Vitality; Vitality
being the sum of the properties of matter in the state of
organization.</p>

<p>43. Vital phenomena are the phenomena manifested <i>in</i>
organisms when external agencies disturb their molecular
equilibrium; and <i>by</i> organisms when they react on external
objects. Thus everything done in an organism,
or by an organism, is a vital act, although physical and
chemical agencies may form essential components of the
act. If I shrink when struck, or if I whip a horse, the
blow is in each case physical, but the shrinking and the
striking are vital.</p>

<p>Every part of a living organism is therefore vital, as
<i>pertaining</i> to Life; but no part has this Life when isolated;
for Life is the synthesis of all the parts: a federation
of the organs when the organism is complex, a federation
of the organic substances when the organism is a
simple cell.</p>

<p>44. All definitions, although didactically placed at the
introduction of a treatise, are properly the final expression
of the facts which the treatise has established, and they
cannot therefore be fully apprehended until the mind is
familiarized with the details they express. Much, therefore,
which to the reader may seem unintelligible or
questionable in the foregoing definition, must be allowed
to pass until he has gone through the chapters which
follow.</p>

<span class="subhead">ORGANISM, ORGANIZATION, AND ORGANIC SUBSTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p id="I_45">45. <span class="firstword">There</span> is a marked difference between organ<i>ic</i> and
organ<i>ised</i> substances. The organic are non-living, though
capable of living when incorporated in organized tissue
(albumen is such a substance); or they may be incapable
of living because they have lived, and are products of
waste, e. g. urea. The organized substance is a specific
combination of organic substances of various kinds, a
combination which is organization. Any organized substance
is therefore either an independent organism, or
part of a more complex organism. Protoplasm, either as
a separate organism or as a constituent of a tissue, is
organized substance.</p>

<p>Organic substances are numerous and specific. They
are various combinations of proximate principles familiar
to the chemist, which may conveniently be ranged under
three classes: The first class of organic substances comprises
those composed of principles having what is called
a mineral origin; these generally quit the organism unchanged
as they entered it. The second class comprises
those which are crystallizable, and are formed <i>in</i> the organism,
and generally quit it in this state as excretions.
The third class comprises the colloids, i. e. substances
which are coagulable and not crystallizable, and are
formed in and decomposed in the organism, thus furnishing
the principles of the second class. All the principles
are in a state of solution. Water is the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
vehicle of the materials which enter and the materials
which quit the organism; and bodies in solution are solvents
of others, so that the water thus acquires new solvent
properties.</p>

<p>45<i>a</i>. Two points must be noted respecting organic
substances: they are mostly combinations of <i>higher multiples</i>
of the elements; and their combinations are not
<i>definite</i> in quantity. Albumen, for example, has (according
to one of the many formulas which have been given)
an elementary composition of 216 atoms of Carbon, 169
of Hydrogen, 27 of Nitrogen, 3 of Sulphur, and 68 of
Oxygen; whereas in its final state, in which it quits the
organism as Urea, it is composed of 2 atoms of Carbon,
4 of Hydrogen, 2 of Nitrogen, and 2 of Oxygen, all the
Sulphur having disappeared in other combinations. In
like manner in the organism Stearin falls from C<sub>114</sub>, H<sub>110</sub>,
O<sub>12</sub>, to Oxalic Acid, which is C<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>8</sub>. It is obvious
that the necessary modifiability of organic substance is
due to this multiplicity of its elementary parts and the
variety of its molecular structure.</p>

<p id="I_45b">45<i>b</i>. Nor is the indefiniteness of the quantitative composition
less important, though seldom adequately appreciated,
or even suspected. Robin and Verdeil<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> are the
only writers I can remember who have distinctly brought
the fact into prominence. That all inorganic substances
are definite in composition, every one knows. Quicklime,
for example, may be got from marble, limestone,
oyster-shells, or chalk; but however produced, it always
contains exactly 250 ounces of calcium to 100 ounces of
oxygen; just as water is always OH<sub>2</sub>. Not so the pre-eminently
vital substances, those which are coagulable
and not crystallizable: no precise formula will express
one of these; for the same specific substance is found to
vary from time to time, and elementary analyses do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
give uniform results. Thus, if after causing an acid to
combine with one of these substances, we remove the
acid, we are not certain of finding the substance as it was
before—as we are, for example, after urea is combined
with nitric acid and then decomposed. The same want
of definiteness is of course even more apparent in the
<i>combinations</i> of these proximate principles into organized
substance. Protoplasm differs greatly in different places.
Epithelial cells differ. Muscular and nervous fibres are
never absolutely the same in different regions. A striped
and unstriped muscular fibre, the muscular fibre of a
sphincter or of a limb, a nerve-fibre in a centre, in a
trunk, or in a gland, will present variations of composition.
The elastic fibres of the ligaments are larger in
the horse than in man; and in other animals they are
smaller. These differences are sometimes due to the
constituents, and sometimes to the arrangement of the
constituents; the conversion of Albumen into Fibrine
without elementary loss or addition, is a good example of
the latter. That the tissues of one man are not absolutely
the same as the tissues of another, in the sense in which
it is true to say that the chalk of one hill is the same as
that of another, or as gold in Australia is the same as gold
in Mexico, is apparent in their very different reactions
under similar external conditions: the substance which
poisons the one leaves the other unaffected. The man
who has once had the small-pox, or scarlet fever, is never
the same afterwards, since his organism has now become
insusceptible of these poisons. And Sir James Paget has
called attention to the striking fact revealed in disease,
namely, that in the same tissue—say the bone or the
skin—a morbid substance fastens only on certain small
portions leaving all the rest unaltered, but fastens on
exactly corresponding spots of the opposite sides of the
body; so that on both arms, or both legs, only the corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
bits of tissue will be diseased. “Manifestly
when two substances display different relations to a third
their composition cannot be identical; so that though we
may speak of all bone or of all skin as if it were all alike,
yet there are differences of intimate composition. No
power of artificial chemistry can detect the difference;
but a morbid material can.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> It is to this variability of
composition that we must refer individual peculiarities,
and those striking forms of variety known as idiosyncrasies,
which cause some organisms to be affected by
what seem inexplicable influences—physical and moral.</p>

<p>In spite of all these variations, however, there are certain
specific resemblances dependent of course on similarity of
composition and structure, so that the muscle of a crustacean
is classed beside the muscle of a vertebrate, although
the elementary analysis of the two yields different results.
Nerve-tissue, according to my experience, is the most variable
of all, except the blood; variable not only from
individual to individual, and from genus to genus, but
even in the same individual it never contains the same
quantities of water, phosphates, etc. Hence it is that different
nerves manifest different degrees of excitability,
and the same nerve differs at different times. Thus the
fifth pair, in a poisoned animal, retains its excitability long
after the others are paralyzed; and the patient under chloroform
feels a prick on the brow or at the temples, when
insensible at any other spot. The pneumogastric which
is excitable during digestion is—in dogs at least—inexcitable
when the animal is fasting.</p>

<p>46. The organic substances are what analysis discovers
in organized substances, but none of them, not even the
highest, is living, except as organized. Albumen alone, or
Stearin alone, is as incapable of Vitality, as Plumbago, or
Soda; but all organic substances are capable of playing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
part in vital actions; and this part is the more important
in proportion to their greater molecular variety. Organization
is a special synthesis of substances belonging to all
three classes; and the organized substance, thus formed,
alone merits the epithet living. We see how organized
substances, being constituted by principles derived from
the inorganic world, and principles derived from the organic
world, have at once a dependence on the external
Medium, and an independence of it, which is peculiar to
living beings. An analogous dependence and independence
is noticeable with respect to the parts; and this is a
character not found in inorganic compounds. The organism,
even in its simplest forms, is a structure of different
substances, each of which is complex. While one part
of a crystal is atomically and morphologically identical
with every other, and is the whole crystal “writ small,”
one part of an organism is unlike another, and <i>no part</i> is
like the whole. Hence the dependence of one organ and
one tissue on another, and each on all. Yet, while every
part is, so to speak, a condition of existence of every
other, and the unity of the organism is but the expression
of this solidarity,—wherever organized substance has
been differentiated into morphological elements (cells, etc.),
each of these has its own course of evolution independently
of the others,—is born, nourished, developed, and
dies.</p>

<p>47. The interdependence of nerve and muscle is seen
in this, that the more the muscle is excited the feebler its
contractions become; this decrease in contractility is compensated
by an increased excitability in its nerve; so that
while the muscle demands a more powerful stimulus, the
nerve acquires a more energetic activity. Ranke’s curious
and careful experiments seem to prove that this depends
on the wearied muscle absorbing more water, owing to the
acids developed by its activity, and on the nerve losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
this water—a nerve being always more irritable when its
quantity of water diminishes.</p>

<p>48. Herein we see illustrated the great law of organized
activity, that it is a simultaneity of opposite tendencies,
as organized matter is a synthesis of compositions
and decompositions, always tending towards equilibrium
and disturbance, storing up energy and liberating it. Unlike
what is observed in unorganized matter, the conditions
of waste bring with them conditions of repair, and
thus—within certain limits—every loss in one direction
is compensated by gain in another. There is a greater
flow of nutrient material, or, more properly speaking, a
greater assimilation of it by the tissue, where there has
been made a greater opening for it by previous disintegration.
The alkaline state of the nutrient material, and the
acid state of the material that has been used,—the alkaline
state which characterizes repose and assimilation, and
the acid state which characterizes activity and deassimilation,
are but cases of this general law; on the synthesis
of these opposite tendencies depends the restless change,
together with the continued specific integrity, of organized
matter.</p>

<p id="I_49">49. The state of organization may therefore be defined
as the <i>molecular union of the proximate principles of the
three classes in reciprocal dissolution</i>. An organism is
formed of matter thus organized, which exists in two
states—the <i>amorphous</i> and the <i>figured</i>. The amorphous
substances are liquid, semi-liquid, and solid; the figured
are the cells, fibres, and tubes, called “anatomical elements.”
For these I prefer the term suggested, I believe,
by Milne Edwards, namely, <i>organites</i>, because they are the
individual elements which mainly constitute the organs,
and are indeed by many biologists considered as elementary
organisms. These organites, which go to form the
tissues, and by the tissues the organs, have their specific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
form, volume, structure, and chemical reactions. They
exist in textures or tissues, or separately (e. g. blood corpuscles),
and are in many respects like the simplest organisms
known, such as Monads, Vibrios, Amœbæ, etc.</p>

<p>50. The simplest form of life is not—as commonly
stated—a cell, but a microscopic lump of jelly-like substance,
or protoplasm, which has been named <i>sarcode</i>
by Dujardin, <i>cytode</i> by Haeckel, and <i>germinal matter</i> by
Lionel Beale. This protoplasm, although entirely destitute
of texture, and consequently destitute of organs, is nevertheless
considered to be living, because it manifests the
cardinal phenomena of Life: Assimilation, Evolution,
Reproduction, Mobility, and Decay. Examples of this
simplest organism are Monads, Protamœbæ, and Polythalamia.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
Few things are more surprising than the vital
activity of these organites, which puzzle naturalists as to
whether they should be called plants or animals. All
microscopists are familiar with the spectacle of a formless
lump of albuminous matter (a Rhizopod) putting forth a
process of its body as a temporary arm or leg, or else
slowly wrapping itself round a microscopic plant, or morsel
of animal substance, thus converting its whole body
into a mouth and a stomach; but these phenomena are
surpassed by those described by Cienkowski,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> who narrates
how one Monad fastens on to a plant and sucks the
chlorophyll first from one cell and then from another;
another Monad, unable to make a hole in the cell-wall,
thrusts long processes of its body into the opening already
made, and drags out the remains of the chlorophyll left
there by its predecessor; while a third Monad leads a
predatory life, falling upon other Monads that have filled
themselves with food. Here, as he says, we stand on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
threshold of that dark region where Animal Will begins;
and yet there is here only the simplest form of organization.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>51. Now let our glance pass on to the second stage—the
Cell. Here we have a recognized differentiation in
the appearance of a nucleus amid the protoplasm. The
nucleus is chemically different from the substance which
surrounds it; and although perhaps exaggerated importance
has been attributed to this nucleus, and mysterious
powers have been ascribed to it, yet as an essential
constituent of the cell it commands attention. Indeed,
according to the most recent investigations, the definition
of a cell is “a nucleus with surrounding protoplasm.”
The cell-wall, or delicate investing membrane—that
which makes the cell a closed sac—is no longer
to be regarded as a necessary constituent, but only as an
accessory.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
52. The cell may be either an organism or an organite.
It may lead an isolated life as plant or animal, or it may
be united with others and lead a more or less corporate
existence; but always, even as an element of a higher
organism, it preserves its own individuality. At first we
see that the corporate union is very slight, merely the
contact of one cell with another of its own kind, as in
the filament of a Conferva. Rising higher, we see the
cell united with others different from it; plants and animals
appear, having structures composed of masses of
various cells. Rising still higher, we see animal forms
of which the web is woven out of myriads upon myriads
of cells, with various cell-products, processes, fibres,

<p>53. But we have only one half of the great problem of
life, when we have the organism; and it is to this half
that the chief researches have been devoted, the other
falling into neglect. What is that other? The Medium
in which the organism lives. Every individual object,
organic or inorganic, is the product of two factors:—first,
the relation of its constituent molecules to each other;
secondly, the relation of its substance to all surrounding
objects. Its properties, as an object or an organism, are
the results of its constituent molecules, and of its relation
to external conditions. Organisms are the results of a
peculiar group of forces, exhibiting a peculiar group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
phenomena. Viewing these in the abstract, we may say
that there are three regulative laws of life:—(1) The <i>Lex
Formationis</i>—the so-called <i>nisus formativus</i>, or “organizing
force”; (2) the <i>Lex Adaptationis</i>, or adaptive tendency;
(3) the <i>Lex Hereditatis</i>, or tendency to reproduce
both the original form and its acquired modifications.
We have always to consider the organizing force in relation
to all surrounding forces—a relation succinctly expressed
in the word Adaptation. Just as water is water
only under a certain relation of its constituent molecules
to the temperature and atmospheric pressure—just as it
passes into other forms (ice or steam) in adapting itself
to other conditions; so, likewise, the organism only preserves
its individuality by the adjustment of its forces
with the forces which environ it.</p>

<p id="I_54">54. This relation of Organism and Medium, the most
fundamental of biological data, has had a peculiar fortune:
never wholly unrecognized, for it obtrudes itself
incessantly in the facts of daily experience, it was very
late in gaining recognition as a principle of supreme importance;
and is even now often so imperfectly apprehended
that one school of philosophers indignantly rejects
the idea of the Organism and Medium being the
two factors of which Life is the product. Not only is
there a school of vitalists maintaining the doctrine of
Life as an entity independent both of Organism and
Medium, and using these as its instruments; but there
is also a majority among other biologists, who betray by
their arguments that they fail to keep steadily before
them the fundamental nature of the relation. Something
of this is doubtless due to the imperfect conception they
have formed of what constitutes the Medium; instead of
recognizing in it the sum of external conditions affecting
the organism—i. e. the sum of the relations which the
organism maintains with external agencies,—they restrict,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
or enlarge it, so as to misapprehend its significance—restrict
it to only a few of the conditions, such as
climate, soil, temperature, etc., or enlarge it to embrace
a vast array of conditions which stand in no directly
appreciable relation to the organism. Every one understands
that an organism is dependent on proper food, on
oxygen, etc., and will perish if these are withheld, or be
affected by every variation in such conditions. Every
one understands that an animal which can devour or be
devoured by another, will flourish or perish according to
the presence of its prey or its enemy. But it is often
forgotten that among external existences, all those which
stand in no appreciable relation to the organism are not
properly to be included in its Medium. In consequence
of this oversight we frequently hear it urged as an objection
to the Evolution Hypothesis, that manifold organisms
exist under the <i>same</i> external conditions, and that
organisms persist unchanged amid a great variety of conditions.
The objection is beside the question. In the
general sum of external forces there are certain items
which are nearly related to particular organisms, and
constitute their Medium; those items which are so distantly
related to these organisms as to cause no reactions
in them, are, for them, as if non-existent.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Of the manifold
vibrations which the ether is supposed to be incessantly
undergoing, only certain vibrations affect the eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
as light; these constitute the Medium of Sight; the
others are as if they were not. Only certain vibrations
of the air affect the ear as Sound; to all other vibrations
we are deaf; though ears of finer sensibility may detect
them and be deaf to those which affect us.</p>

<p>55. “The external conditions of existence” is therefore
the correct definition of the Medium. An animal may
be surrounded with various foods and poisons, but if its
organism is not directly affected by them they cannot be
food or poison to it. An animal may be surrounded with
carnivorous rivals, but if it is not adapted to serve them as
food, or is too powerful to be attacked by them, they only
indirectly enter into its Medium, by eating the food it
would eat. The analogy is similar with anorganisms and
their relation to their media. Every physical or chemical
phenomenon depends on the concurrence of definite conditions:
namely, the substance which manifests the change,
and the medium in which the change is manifested. Alter
the medium, solid, liquid, or gaseous, change its thermal
or electrical state, and the phenomenon is altered. But
although similar alterations in the medium notoriously
influence the organism, yet, because a great many variations
in external conditions are unaccompanied by appreciable
changes in the organism, there are biologists who
regard this as a proof of Life being independent of physical
and chemical laws; an error arising from their not
recognizing the precise nature of organic conditions.</p>

<p>56. To give greater precision to the conception of a
Medium it will be desirable to adopt the distinction much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
insisted on by Claude Bernard, namely, 1°, an External or
Cosmical Medium, embracing the whole of the circumstances
outside the organism, capable of directly affecting
it, and 2°, an Internal or Physiological Medium, embracing
the conditions inside the organism, and in direct relation
with it—that is to say, the plasma in which its tissues
are bathed, by which they are nourished. To these
add its temperature and electrical conditions. Bernard
only includes the nutritive fluid; but inasmuch as each
organism possesses a temperature and electrical state of
its own, and these are only indirectly dependent on the
external temperature and electricity, and as it is with these
internal conditions that the organism is in direct relation,
I include them with the plasma among the constituents of
the Physiological Medium. Any change in the External
Medium, whether of temperature or electricity, of food or
light, which does not disturb the Internal Medium, will of
course leave the organism undisturbed; and for the most
part all the changes in the External Medium which do
affect the organism, affect it by first changing the Internal
Medium. External heat or cold raises or depresses the
internal temperature <i>indirectly</i> by affecting the organic
processes on which the internal temperature depends.
We see here the rationale of acclimatization. Unless the
organism can adapt itself to the new External Medium by
the readjustment of its Internal Medium, it perishes.</p>

<p>57. We are now enabled to furnish an answer to the
very common objection respecting the apparent absence of
any direct influence of external conditions. Let the objection
first be stated in the words of a celebrated naturalist,
Agassiz: “It is a fact which seems to be entirely overlooked
by those who assume an extensive influence of
physical causes upon the very existence of organized
beings, that the most diversified types of animals and
plants are everywhere found under identical circumstances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
The smallest sheet of fresh water, every point of the
sea-shore, every acre of dry land, teems with a variety of
animals and plants. The narrower the boundaries which
are assigned as the primitive home of all these beings,
the more uniform must be the conditions under which
they must be assumed to have originated; so uniform
indeed that in the end the inference would be that the
same physical causes can produce the most diversified
effects.”</p>

<p>Obviously there is a complete misstatement of the argument
here; and the excess of the misstatement appears
in the following passage: “The action of physical agents
upon organized beings presupposes the very existence of
those beings.” Who ever doubted it? “The simple fact
that there has been a period in the history of our earth
when none of these organized beings as yet existed, and
when, nevertheless, the material constitution of our globe
and the physical forces acting upon it were essentially
the same as they are now, shows that these influences
are insufficient to call into existence any living being.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
Although most readers will demur to the statement that
because the material constitution of our globe was “essentially
the same” before and after animal life appeared,
therefore there could have been no special conditions determining
the appearance of Life, the hypothesis of Evolution
entirely rejects the notion of organic forms having
been diversified by diversities in the few physical conditions
commonly understood as representing the Medium.
Mr. Darwin has the incomparable merit of having enlarged
our conception of the conditions of existence so as to
embrace <i>all</i> the factors which conduce to the result. In
his luminous principle of the Struggle for Existence, and
the Natural Selection which such a struggle determines,
we have the key to most of the problems presented by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the diversities of organisms; and the Law of Adaptation,
rightly conceived, furnishes the key to all organic
change.</p>

<p>58. In consequence of the defective precision with
which the phrase “Medium,” or its usual equivalent
“physical conditions,” is employed, several biological
errors pass undetected. Haeckel<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> calls attention to the
common mistake of supposing the organism to be passive
under the influence of external conditions, whereas every
action, be it of light or heat, of water or food, necessarily
calls forth a corresponding reaction, which manifests itself
in a modification of the nutritive process. He points out
the obverse of this error in the current notion that Habit
is solely due to the spontaneous action of the organism,
in opposition to the influence of external agency,—as if
every action were not the response to a stimulus. Corresponding
with the fluctuations in the Medium there must
necessarily be fluctuations of Adaptation, and I think we
may safely assume that it is only when these fluctuations
cease that the Adaptation becomes Habit. This is the
interpretation of the phrase “Habit is <i>second</i> Nature,” and
is very different from the common interpretation which
attributes it to the use or disuse of organs; as if use or
disuse were a spontaneous uncaused activity.</p>

<p>59. The organism, simple or complex, is, we have already
seen, built up from materials originally derived from
the External Medium, but proximately from the Internal
Medium. This statement, however, requires some qualification,
especially in view of the hypothesis that organized
substance was originally created such as we now find
it, and not evolved from inorganic materials. Whether
this hypothesis be adopted, or rejected, we have the fact
that the immense majority of organisms <i>now</i> existing—if
not all—are products of pre-existing organisms; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
therefore organized matter is now mainly, if not solely,
formed by organized matter.</p>

<p>We take, therefore, as our point of departure, the protoplasm;
this is the first of the three terms of the vital
synthesis: Structure, Aliment, and Instrument. The evolution
of this is proximately dependent on the <i>pabulum</i>
afforded it in the Internal Medium, which is the true
nutrient material, and to which what is usually called
<i>food</i> stands in an external relation: for between the reception
of food and its assimilation by the organite, there is
an indispensable intermediary stage, through which matter
passes from the unorganized to the organized state. This
intermediate is now recognized in plants as in animals.
The old belief that plants were nourished <i>directly</i> from
the soil and atmosphere can no longer be sustained. The
process of Nutrition is alike in both: in both the materials
drawn from the External Medium are formed into
proximate principles and organic substances. It is daily
becoming more and more probable that the inorganic
materials, water and oxygen, so freely entering into the organism,
never pass directly from the External Medium to
the tissues, but have to pass through the Internal Medium
where they are changed, so that the water is no longer
free, but exists in a fixed state which has no analogue out
of the living substance. Only a part of the water can be
pressed out mechanically; the rest—that which is already
incorporated with the other elements—can only be got
rid of in a vacuum and at a high temperature. Oxygen,
also, comports itself differently in the tissue; as is proved
by the fact that its physiological absorption is markedly
different from any chemical oxidation in a dead or decomposing
tissue.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Be this as it may, we know that organic
substances have to be unbuilt and rebuilt in the organism;
that the albumen of our food never passes directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
into the albumen of our tissues; any more than the milk
drunk by a nursing mother will pass into her breasts, and
increase her supply, except by nourishing her.</p>

<p>60. In the First Series of these Problems the term
Bioplasm was employed to designate this organized part
of the Internal Medium. I was led to adopt it as a corresponding
term to that of Psychoplasm, by which I
wished to designate the <i>sentient</i> material of the psychological
medium. There can be little doubt that the term
Bioplasm was an unconscious reproduction of the title of
Dr. Beale’s work, which I must have seen advertised. I
withdraw it now that I have read Dr. Beale’s work, and
see that the signification he attaches to the term is almost
identical with Protoplasm. In lieu thereof, the term
Plasmode (from <i>plasma</i>, anything formed, and <i>odos</i>, a
pathway) may be substituted: it represents the <i>nutrient</i>
material on its way to form Protoplasm, which is <i>formative</i>
material; while the materials <i>formed</i> may be termed
Organites and Products: the organite being the cell or
cell-derivative (fibre, tube); the products being the gaseous
liquid and solid derivatives of vital processes, which are
<i>secretions</i> when they form intercellular substance or return
into the plasmode and re-enter the vital circle; <i>excretions</i>
when they are rejected, as incapable of further assimilation.
The liver-cell will furnish an example of each kind
of product. The bile, though containing principles serviceable
in the chemical transformations, is for the most part
excreted; but besides bile, the liver-cell produces starchy
and saccharine principles which are true secretions, and
re-enter the plasmode.</p>

<p>61. The organite is thus composed of sap, substance,
and product; the organism, of plasmode, tissue, and product.
A glance at the vegetable-cell shows it to be constituted
by the primordial utricle, or protoplasm, the
outermost layer of which is condensed into a membrane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
or cell-wall, and the cavity thus enclosed is filled with sap.
The cell-wall grows as the protoplasm grows, and the protoplasm
draws its material from the plasmode. A glance
at the blood, the great reservoir of the river of life, shows
us plasmode in the serum, and organites in the corpuscles;
the one distinguished by sodic salts, the other by
potassic salts. The plasmode, or serum, is in a constant
change of composition and decomposition, giving up to
the various tissue-organites and intercellular plasmodes
the requisite materials, and receiving from organites and
plasmodes the products of their changes. The serum is
fed from the food <i>and</i> the tissues; and it feeds the several
plasmodes which bathe the several tissues. Passing into
the capillaries, it becomes transformed as it passes through
their walls into the intercellular spaces, saturating the
acid products of the cell-activities with its alkalies, and
furnishing the protoplasms with their needed materials.</p>

<p>62. It will be understood that, although in appearance
these stages are sharply defined, in reality they are insensible.
But from the analytical point of view we may regard
Nutrition as the office of the plasmode, and Evolution
as the office of the protoplasm. Although evolution
or genesis of form depends on assimilation, it is not a
necessary consequence: the plasmode or the protoplasm
might preserve such perfect equality in the waste and
repair, such complete equilibrium, as not to undergo any
development. The ova, for example, which exist in the
ovaries at birth are not all subsequently developed; and
if with modern embryologists we conclude that there is
no replacement of these by proliferation we shall in them
have examples of organites remaining unchanged through
a period of fifty years.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> But such an equilibrium is perhaps
only possible in complete inactivity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
63. Again, although the office of the plasmode is primarily
that of forming protoplasm, I think there is evidence
to suggest that it not only does this, but that some of it
is used in the direct development of energy, especially
heat and electricity. The various forms of starch and
sugar taken in with the food or formed in the liver, certainly
do not as such enter into protoplasm. The same
with alcohol.</p>

<p>64. It is perhaps in forgetfulness of the artificial nature
of analytical distinctions that controversies rage respecting
what are called intercellular substances and cell-walls.
Now that the wall is no longer regarded as an essential
constituent of the cell, but as a secondary formation, two
opinions are maintained: first, that it is merely a concentration
of the external layer of protoplasm; secondly,
that it is a product of secretion from the protoplasm.
Both positions may be correct. Certainly in some cases
there is no other appreciable difference between wall and
protoplasm than that of a greater consistence; whereas
in many other cases there exists a decided difference in
their chemical reactions, showing a difference of composition.
Taking both orders of fact, we may conclude that
the cell-wall is sometimes part of the organite, and sometimes
product: a blood-cell and a cartilage-cell may be
cited as examples of each. And this argument applies to
the intercellular substance also.</p>

<p>65. The terms plasmode and protoplasm are general,
and include many species. There are different plasmodes
for the different tissues, so that we find phosphates of
soda in the blood-serum, phosphates of potash in the
nerve-plasma, phosphates of magnesia in the muscle-plasma,
and phosphates of lime in the bone-plasma; having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
severally to form the specifically different protoplasms
of these tissues. Observe, moreover, the gradations of
these in respect of their physical state: the blood being
the most liquid, the nerve a degree more solid, the muscle
still more solid, and the bone almost entirely solid; and
since solubility of material is a necessary condition of the
chemical changes, we can understand how the blood, the
nerve, the muscle, and the bone represent degrees of vital
activity: the greater the instability of organized substance,
the more active its molecular renovation. Many
serious errors result from overlooking the specific differences
of protoplasms; among them may be mentioned that
very common one of asserting that the ovum of a man is
not distinguishable from the ovum of any other mammal,
nor the ovum of a mammal from that of a reptile; nay,
we sometimes see it stated that the protoplasm from
which a mammal may be developed is the same as that
which is the germ of an oak. So long as this simply
asserts that we have at present no means of distinguishing
them by any chemical or physical tests, there can be
no objection raised; but it is a serious misconception,
which any embryological investigation ought to rectify,
to suppose that the ovum is not specific from the
first.</p>

<p>66. Between the organites and their plasmodes there
is the necessary relation, which corresponds with the relation
between organisms and their mediums. Once formed,
the organites are arranged side by side, or end on end,
into textures or tissues, and these are grouped into organs,
every organ being constituted by a collection of tissues,
as every apparatus is by a collection of organs, and the
organism by the federation of all the parts. We have
more than once insisted on the necessity of synthetic interpretation
to complete the indications of analysis: which
means that no account of vital phenomena is <i>real</i> unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
it takes in all the co-operant factors, both those of the organism
and the medium. Neglect of this canon vitiates
Dr. Beale’s otherwise remarkable labors.</p>

<h3 id="sec_6">THE HYPOTHESIS OF GERMINAL MATTER.</h3>

<p>67. It may help to elucidate certain important points
if I here examine the hypothesis which Dr. Beale has
worked out with such patient skill, but with what seem
to me such unphysiological results. He deserves, I think,
more applause than has been awarded to him, not only
for the admirable patience with which he has pursued the
idea, but also for the striking definiteness of the idea itself—always
a great advantage in an hypothesis, since it
gives precision to research. If biologists have paid but
little attention to it, this is no doubt due to the theoretical,
still more than to the observational contradictions it
presents. Histologists dispute his facts, or his interpretations;
while other biologists do not see their way in the
application of his hypothesis. Respecting all disputed
points of observation I shall be silent, for I have myself
made no systematic researches in this direction, such as
would entitle me to form an estimate of the evidence.
But my dissent from the hypothesis is founded on biological
principles so fundamental that I should be willing
to take my stand entirely on the facts he himself puts
forward.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>68. The hypothesis is that nothing in the organism has
any claim to vitality except the minute masses of protoplasm
(by him called bioplasm), which in the egg represent,
he thinks, about the one-thousandth part of the
whole mass, the rest being lifeless matter, namely, pabulum,
and formed material. This bioplasm is the <i>germinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
matter</i> out of which, by a <i>process of dying</i>, arise
the tissues and humors constituting the <i>formed material</i>—these,
with the pabulum which feeds the germinal
matter, being all dead material. The germinal matter
itself, though living, only lives because there is temporarily
associated with it that Vital Force of which we
have already spoken (§ <a href="#I_14">14</a>). In virtue of this association,
a particle of matter not exceeding the one hundred-thousandth
of an inch in diameter is said to be alive;
and, presumably, to contain within it all those manifold
powers which the term Life condenses. The pabulum
brought under the influence of this Vital Force is transformed
into germinal matter which, escaping from this
mysterious influence, <i>dies into tissue</i>. Muscle-fibres and
nerve-fibres are thus not living parts, nor are their actions
vital. So that, to be consistent, we must not speak
of the organism as living, but as a dead structure <i>produced</i>
by the Vital Force, and <i>set in action</i> by the aid of
scattered bits of germinal matter. He has not, I think,
stated whether each of these bioplasms has its own Vital
Force, so that the organism is the theatre of millions of
Vital Forces; or whether it is one Vital Force which animates
the whole organic world of plants and animals.
But nothing can be less equivocal than his position respecting
the lifelessness of every part of the organism
except the germinal matter.</p>

<p>69. The germinal matter may be selected as the primary
stage of the formed material, the initial point of
growth, and thus stand for the pre-eminently distinctive
centre of Nutrition; but were we to limit all Nutrition
to the germinal matter, as defined by Dr. Beale, and deny
the co-operation of all the formed material, we should
still not be justified in restricting Life to simple Nutrition.
We cannot exclude such phenomena as those of
Sensation and Motion, nor can we assign these to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
germinal matter.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> To suppose this, would be equivalent
to saying that the steam which issues from a teakettle
is capable of the actions of a locomotive engine. The
steam from the kettle is like the steam from the boiler, it
has molecular energy, and by this will co-operate in the
production of mechanical work, if the mechanism be adjusted
to it. The molecular energy of the protoplasm in
muscular fibre may be indispensable to the movements of
the muscles, but these, and not the protoplasmic movements
alone, are muscular contractions. An hypothesis,
therefore, which is obliged to declare that muscle-fibre
and nerve-fibre are not living, even when active in the
organism, seems to me defective at its base. If we view
these apart from the organism, they may, like all the
other formed materials, be regarded as dead; and no one
doubts that epidermis, nail, horn, hair, and bone are dead
in this sense, that they cannot live independently, and
do not reproduce themselves. But so long as even these
form constituents of the living organism, they also are
<i>living</i> (§ <a href="#I_42">42</a>).<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> It is only by a misconception of the analytical
artifice that so simple a truth could have been
missed.</p>

<p>70. But this misconception meets us at many a turn.
The Vitalist hypothesis of an extra-organic agent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
course refuses to regard Life as the expression of all the
co-operant conditions; and even opponents of that hypothesis
often fall into the same error of principle, when
they attempt to explain Life by localizing it in the cells;
which is simply a morphological substitution for the once
popular doctrine that only the vascular parts were organized,
and every part destitute of blood-vessels was dead.
This idea seemed supported by the facts of the most
highly vascular parts being the most vital, and of a parallelism
existing between the vital activity of those
organs which when injected seemed almost entirely composed
of blood-vessels, as the liver and brain, and those
which showed scarcely a trace of vessels, as cartilage and
bone; it seemed supported also by the appearance of
blood-vessels in all new formations, and by the idea of
the blood as the nutrient fluid. Then came the cell-doctrine,
and the belief that the cell was the really ultimate
morphological element—which may be true—and that
“here alone there is any manifestation of life to be found,
so that we must not transfer the seat of vital action anywhere
beyond the cell,”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>—which is very questionable.</p>

<p>71. We have already seen that the cell is an anatomical
element, or organite; the organism is but an aggregate
of organites <i>and</i> their plasmodes. But Biology,
which deals with the organism as a whole, and with functions
which are the resultants of all the vital properties,
must not be restricted to any single factor, however important.
It would assuredly be deemed absurd to say
that diamond rings and lead-pencils were the same, because
the diamond and the plumbago, which are the
specific elements of each, are both the same chemical
element,—carbon. The substance is really different in
diamond and plumbago, is different in properties, and is,
in rings and pencils, united with different substances into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
objects having very different properties. Whatever analysis
may discover as to the identities of organic structures,
we cannot explain a single vital phenomenon without
taking into account the three terms, Structure, Aliment,
and Instrument; and whenever a cell is said to be
the seat of vital action, these three terms must be implied.
In Dr. Beale’s hypothesis the restriction is carried
to its extreme; not content with the cell, he withdraws
vital action from the cell as a whole, assigning it to the
protoplasm and nucleus—cell-contents and cell-wall being,
in his view, dead. If it be true that the protoplasm
is alone concerned in Nutrition, yet Nutrition is not Life.
Occupied mainly with formative processes, it leaves other
indispensable processes to other parts. He instances the
removal of all the tissues during the metamorphoses of
insects:—“new organs and textures are laid down afresh
and developed <i>ab initio</i>, instead of being built up upon
those first formed.” But to show how he restricts the
idea of Life, he adds: “Such complete change, however,
necessitates a state of existence during which <i>action</i> or
<i>function remains in complete abeyance</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The muscles and nerves which are instrumental in this
functional life are said to be dead. It is true that the
muscle-fibre does not develop fresh fibres. But it is
equally true that the protoplasm of muscle does not alone
execute <i>muscular</i> contraction. Each has its special office.
Hence I reject the idea that formed material is dead.
He further says “formed material may <i>be</i> changed, it cannot
<i>change</i> itself.” The antithesis is doubly inexact: 1°,
nothing changes itself, but only yields to pressure, or reacts
on being stimulated; and 2°, all the evidence at hand
is against the notion that the formed material is not the
seat of incessant molecular change; it is wasted and repaired
molecule by molecule. Kölliker properly protests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
against the growing tendency of histologists to deify
protoplasm, and to make it the sole seat of vital changes,
the cell-wall and cell-products having also, he says,
their physiological importance. It is manifestly erroneous
to deny vital changes to the red blood-corpuscles
on the ground of their no longer containing germinal
matter.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>72. The analytical view may separate certain parts as
active, and other parts as passive, and thus regard the cells
as the seats of vital activity, the intercellular substance
as merely accessory and instrumental; but the real or
synthetical view must recognize both parts as equally
indispensable, equally vital. Take cartilage, for instance,
with its enormous preponderance of intercellular substance
(formed material), and consider how absolutely
impossible any of its uses would be were it reduced to
the germinal matter of its corpuscles! And so of all the
tissues.</p>

<p>73. If formed material is not to be excluded from the
living parts of the organism, neither is the plasmode, out
of which the germinal matter arises, since here we have
the nutritive changes in their highest activity; and because
the property of Nutrition is here most active, the
other property of Development is in abeyance. Dr. Beale
holds that pabulum necessarily becomes germinal matter;
but when we come to treat of Nutrition it will appear
that this is not more true than that Food necessarily becomes
Tissue: some of it does; but much of it is used
up for heat and other purposes.</p>

<p id="I_74">74. What is true and important in the distinction between
germinal matter and formed material is, that from
the former onwards there is a gradual process of devitalization,
the older parts of every organite and tissue approaching
more and more to the state of inorganic matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
But to show how vain is the attempt to restrict Vitality
to any one out of a complex of co-operant factors, we
might set up a chemical hypothesis to the effect that
Vitality depends on phosphates, and with it explain the
phenomena quite as well as with the hypothesis of germinal
matter. For not only is it found that the productive
quality of a soil depends on its richness in phosphates,
but, as Lehmann has shown, wherever cells and
fibres make their appearance phosphates are found, even in
the lowest organisms, which, however, contain but little.
Phosphates abound in seeds and ova, in muscles and ganglia,
and are deficient in the woody parts of plants and
the elastic fibres of animals. The infant absorbs phosphates
in large quantities and excretes them in small
quantities. Nervous activity is accompanied by the consumption
of a third more phosphorus than accompanies
muscular activity. Phosphates are among the most energetic
of organic stimulants. But who would endow the
phosphates with Vitality, on the ground of their indispensable
presence in all vital processes?</p>

<p>75. Life, as we saw, is the expression of the whole
organism. Many of the parts are incapable of manifesting
any vital phenomena except in connection with all the
rest; and of those parts which may be separated from the
organism and continue to manifest some vital phenomena,
none are capable of manifesting all. When the connexus
of the parts is destroyed the organism is dead. Long
after that cessation which we call Death, there are still
evidences of Vitality in some of the parts: the heart will
continue to beat, the glands will secrete, the hair will
grow, the temperature will still be above that of the surrounding
medium, the muscles will be excitable; these
vital properties are the activities of organized substances,
and so long as the state of organization is preserved they
are preserved; but the Life, which is the synthesis of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the vital properties, vanishes with the destruction of that
synthesis.</p>

<p>76. May we not generalize this, and say that every
special form of existence, organic or inorganic, is determined
by the synthesis of its elements? Atoms are
grouped into molecules, molecules into masses, masses into
systems. Out of the textureless germinal membrane and
the yolk, with no additions from without except oxygen
and heat, are developed all the textures and organs of the
chick; and this chick weighs no more than the egg out
of which it was evolved. The development has been a
succession of syntheses—epigenesis upon epigenesis.
We may, if we please, regard each organite, as it appears,
living its separate life, and each tissue its separate life;
but we must not confound under the same symbol modes
of existence so widely different as the activities of an
organite, and the activities of an organism constituted by
millions of organites.</p>

<p>77. If therefore we cannot restrict Life to the processes
of Nutrition, Dr. Beale’s hypothesis, whatever value it
may have as explaining histogenesis, is quite unacceptable.
Neither Vital Force nor Bioplasm covers the whole
ground. For the former there is no better evidence than
our ignorance of the real synthesis; for the latter the evidence
is positive in its nature, but its interpretation is
questionable. Dr. Beale selects as the germinal matter
those portions of tissue which are susceptible of being
deeply stained by the carmine solution, the formed material
being only stained in a faint degree; the nucleus and
nucleolus are the portions of germinal matter which are
most deeply stained; and hence he concludes that the
older the matter the fainter will be its coloration. There
is no dispute as to the value of the staining process, invented
by Gerlach, for the discrimination of chemically
different parts of a tissue; and Dr. Beale has made excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
use of it in his researches.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> But I altogether dispute
the conclusion that the staining process reveals the parts
which are exclusively vital; and for this reason: it depends
solely on the acid reaction of those parts; and we
cannot divorce the acid from the alkaline agencies, both
being indispensable. Nay, it has been proved that in the
<i>living animal</i> no organized substance can be stained.
Lord Godolphin Osborne first discovered, in 1856, that
the protoplasm of growing wheat was susceptible of coloration;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
but Gerlach, in 1858, found that this never
took place in the <i>animal</i> during life. He kept tadpoles
and intestinal worms for weeks in colored fluids, without
a single spot becoming stained; although no sooner did
these animals die than the staining began. Nor even
when he injected the colored fluids under the skin and
into the stomach, was the slightest coloration produced.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>To Gerlach’s testimony may be added that of Stein,
who, in his magnificent work on <i>Infusoria</i>, says that not
only has no foreign substance ever been found in the protoplasm
of the <i>Opalina</i>, but in the <i>Acineta</i>, and all the
embryos of the higher Infusoria known to him, he has
been unable to color the living substance.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> This resistance
of the living protoplasm is surely a serious objection
to the hypothesis that only those parts of the dead organism
which are stained were the truly vital parts. Ranke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
sums up the results of his experiments thus: “They all
show that the living cell resists the imbibition of every
substance which it cannot assimilate. It is precisely the
impossibility of staining the cell that proves this conclusively,
since every particle of carmine absorbed would
have revealed its presence.”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Dr. Beale was unacquainted
with Gerlach’s experiments. He has at any rate
so far qualified the statement of his hypothesis as to admit
that it is only after death that the germinal matter is
stained. “The living matter” (he says, <i>How to Work with
the Microscope</i>, p. 107) “possesses an acid reaction, or to
speak more correctly, an acid reaction is always developed
immediately after its death.” Now, since this acid reaction
only presents itself after death, and it is this which is
revealed by the carmine, we have no right to conclude
that the carmine singles out the vital parts. Every one
knows that the living muscle and nerve, when in repose,
present an alkaline or faintly neutral reaction, and after
excitation this is changed into an acid reaction, which
increases with the exhaustion of the tissue. In strict
logic, therefore—if we could logically apply such a test—it
is the unstained parts that ought to be called vital.
But, in truth, alkalinity and acidity are equally indispensable.</p>

<p id="I_78">78. The main object of my bringing this question forward
was to illustrate the danger of being misled by
analysis: a danger we shall see to be very serious in psychological
inquiries. The aid derived from analysis need
never be undervalued; all that we have to bear in mind
is that it is only a logical artifice, and that our real explanation
must always be synthetic. Because of the tendency
to rely on analysis there has been an imperfect discrimination
of the profound difference between</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_7">ORGANISMS AND MACHINES;</h3>

<p class="in0">and while on the one hand the legitimate striving of the
biologist to display the mechanism of organic actions has
been denounced by a certain school as Materialism and a
hateful attempt to “rob Life of its mystery,” there has
been on the other hand a misconception of this mechanism,
as if its dependent actions were of the nature of
machines, that is to say, as if organized mechanisms were
strictly comparable with machines constructed of inorganic
parts. No doubt the laws of Mechanics are the
same in both, for these are abstract laws which take no
account of concrete differences. But when elaborate
parallels are drawn up between steam-engines and animal
organisms, the coal consumed in the one likened to
the food in the other, and the force evolved in the combustion
in both being the same, there is a complete obliteration
of all that specially distinguishes vital activity.</p>

<p>79. Between an organism and a machine there is the
superficial resemblance that both have a complex structure,
and are constructed of different and dependent parts.
But underneath this resemblance there is a radical diversity.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
The arrangement of parts in the organism is more
than a <i>juxtaposition</i>, it is a <i>solidarity</i>, arising from the fact
of their being all differentiations from a common substance
which is a special combination of the three classes
of proximate principles. Thus they are not parts which
have been <i>put together</i>, but which have been <i>evolved</i>, each
out of a pre-existing part, and each co-operating in the
very existence of the other. The machine is made of
independent and primarily unrelated parts; its integrity
depends on the continued preservation of the substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of each part; waste is here destruction. The organism
is constituted by interdependent and primarily related
parts; its integrity depends on the continued destruction
and renovation of their substance; waste is a condition of
vitality. The actions of the machine are <i>sub</i>ordinated;
the actions of an organism are <i>co</i>-ordinated. The lever
moves a wheel, and the wheel in moving liberates a
spring, each transmitting a communicated impulse, but
otherwise each acts independently—no slight modification
in the structure or movement of the wheel will
modify the structure or the movements of the lever, no
alteration in the tension of the spring will affect the
structure of the wheel. But in the organism all are parts
of one sympathetic whole; each reacts on each; each is
altered by the other. Not a nerve is stimulated, nor a
muscle moved, but the entire organism is affected. A
condensation here is the cause of a greater imbibition
there. The injection of salt or sugar under the skin of
the frog’s leg will produce cataract in its eye. The activity
of a secreting cell in the ovary, or liver, alters the
condition of the brain; the activity of the brain will check
the secretion of a gland, or relax the sphincters of the
bladder. When we observe the growth of horns, or the
appearance of the beard, concomitant with the secretion
of spermatic cells—and especially when we observe
with these a surprising change in the physical and moral
capabilities and tendencies of the organism—we understand
how the remotest parts of this mechanism are
bound together by one subtle yet all-powerful tie. Nothing
of this is visible in a machine. In a machine the
material is so far of secondary importance that it may be
replaced by materials of various kinds: a pulley may be
worked with a hempen cord, a silken cord, or an iron
chain; a wheel may be wood, iron, copper, brass, or steel;
the actions will in each case be similar. Not so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
organic mechanism: the slightest variation, either in composition
or intimate structure, will affect, and may frustrate
the organic activity. It is only in the skeleton that
the specific character of the materials may be changed;
and here only in the substitution of one phosphate for
another in the solid masonry.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>80. Another marked characteristic of the organism is
that it has a connexus of actions, the simultaneous effect
of a continuous evolution, appearing in stages and ages.
And in the animal organism there is a <i>consensus</i> as well
as a <i>connexus</i>, through which there is evolution of Mind;
and in the Social Organism an evolution of Civilization.
This consensus forms an intermediate stage through
which the animal actions are sensitive as well as nutritive,
and the nutritive are regulated by the sensitive.
It is obvious that nothing like this is to be found in a
machine; and we conclude, therefore, that any view of
the organism which regards its mechanism without taking
in these cardinal characteristics must be radically
defective. We no more deny the existence of mechanical
phenomena in denying that the organism is like a
machine, than we deny the existence of chemical phenomena
in denying that Vitality is chemical.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>81. <span class="firstword">The</span> terms Property and Function are not always
used with desirable precision. There is, however, a
marked distinction between the property which characterizes
a tissue in whatever organ the tissue may be
found, and the function which is exhibited by an organ
composed of several tissues. We ought never to speak
of a function unless we imply the existence of a correlative
organ; and it is therefore incorrect to speak of the
function of Nutrition, since <i>all</i> the tissues nourish themselves;
but we may speak of certain organs as special
instruments in facilitating Nutrition. Thus also with
respiration, usually, but not accurately, spoken of as the
function of the lungs; the lungs being simply the most
effective of the instruments by which the interchange of
gases (which also takes place in every tissue) is facilitated.
If by Respiration we mean Breathing, then, indeed,
Respiration is the function of the lungs; if we
mean the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of
carbonic acid, Respiration is a general property of vital
tissue. A fragment of muscle removed from the body
respires, so long as its organization is intact; but it does
not <i>breathe</i>—it has no accessory instruments, nor does
it need them. The co-operation of nerve centres, diaphragm,
ribs, circulating system, etc., necessary in the
complex organism to bring the due amount of oxygen to
the tissues, and convey away the carbonic acid, is here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
needless. In the ascending animal series we find this
necessity growing with the complexity of the organism.
The whole skin respires in the amphibia, and to some
extent in man also: a frog will live for ten or fourteen
days after extirpation of its lungs, the skin respiring
sufficiently to keep up a feeble vitality. But the skin
does not suffice; and, very early, certain portions are
specialized into organs (at first in the shape of external
gills, and finally as internal lungs), for the more energetic,
because more specialized, performance of this office. In
the simpler organisms the blood is easily reached by the
air; therefore no instrument is needed. In primitive
societies the transport of goods is effected by men and
women carrying them; in civilized societies by the aid
of horses and camels, and wagons drawn by oxen; till
finally these are insufficient, and railways are created,
whose power of transport transcends the earlier methods,
as the breathing of a mammal transcends the respiration
of a mollusc. Breathing is the special function of an
organ—the lungs (or more strictly, the thoracic apparatus)—as
Railway Transport is a special social function.
Although each of the tissues forming this organ can, and
does, exhale carbonic acid and absorb oxygen—and each
of the railway servants can, and does, transport objects
to and from the locomotive—yet the main work is
thrown upon the special apparatus.</p>

<p>82. What is meant by properties of tissue and functions
of organs may be thus illustrated. Let us suppose
ourselves investigating the structure of a ship. We find
it composed of various <i>materials</i>—wood, iron, copper,
hemp, canvas, etc.; and these under various <i>configurations</i>
are formed into particular parts serving particular
purposes, such as deck, masts, anchor, windlass, chains,
ropes, sails, etc. In all these parts the materials preserve
their properties; and wherever wood or iron may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
placed, whatever purpose the part may serve, the properties
of wood and iron are unaffected; and it is through
a combination of these properties that the part is effective;
while through the connection of one part with
another the purpose becomes realized. The purposes to
which masts, ropes, or sails are subservient may be called
their functions; and these of course only exist, <i>as such</i>,
in the ship. It is the same with the organism. We
find it composed of various Tissues, and these are combined
into various Organs or Instruments.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The properties
of Tissues remain the same, no matter into what
Organs they may be combined; they preserve and exert
their physical, chemical, and vital properties, as wood
and iron preserve their properties. Each Tissue has its
characteristic quality; and the Organ which is constructed
out of a combination of several Tissues, more or less
modified, is effective solely in virtue of these properties,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
while the Function of that organ comes into play through
its combination with other organs. For example, muscular
tissue has a vital property which is characteristic
of it, Contractility; and muscles are organs constituted
by this tissue and several others;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> such organs have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
general function of Contraction, but whether this shall
be specially manifested in the beating of the heart, the
winking of the eyelid, the movement of the chest, or the
varied movements of the limbs, will depend on the <i>anatomical
connections</i>. The reader unfamiliar with Biology
is requested to pay very particular attention to this
point; he will find many obscurities dissipated if he once
lays hold of the “principal connections.”</p>

<p>82<i>a</i>. Although Bichat’s conception was of great value,
it was not sufficiently disengaged from the metaphysical
mode of viewing biological phenomena. Both he and
his disciples will be found treating Properties as entities,
and invoking them as <i>causes</i> of the phenomena instead
of recognizing them simply as abstract <i>expressions</i> of the
phenomena. Readers of my First Series will remember
how often I have had occasion to point out this common
error: men having baptized observed facts with a comprehensive
name, forget the process of baptism, and suppose
the name to represent a mysterious agency. The
fact that gases combine is expressed in the term affinity;
and then Affinity is understood to be the cause of the
combinations. The fact that bodies tend towards each
other is called their gravitation, and Gravitation is then
said to cause the tendency. The doctrine of vital properties
has been thus misunderstood. While no one imagines
that he can operate on affinity otherwise than by
operating on the known conditions under which gases
combine, many a biologist and physician speaks as if he
could operate on the Irritability of a tissue, or the Co-ordination
of muscles, by direct action on these abstractions.</p>

<p>Let it be therefore once for all expressly stated that by
the property of a tissue is simply meant the <i>constant mode
of reaction of that tissue under definite conditions</i>. The
property is not a cause, otherwise than the conditions it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
expresses are a cause. And these conditions are first
those of the organized structure itself, and secondly those
of the medium in which it lives. Oxygen unites with
Hydrogen to form water, but only under certain pressures;
so likewise muscles manifest Contractility on being stimulated
(that is their mode of reaction), but only under
certain degrees of temperature, humidity, and a certain
chemical composition of the plasmode. The property is
so truly an expression of the co-operant conditions, that
it is found to vary with those conditions, and to vanish
when they vary beyond a certain limit.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to restrict the notion of a
property to an ultimate fact. Whatever is not reducible
to known conditions is to be accepted as a property.
Combustion, for example, is reducible to the molecular
combination of oxygen and some other gas; but this
combination itself is not reducible, and it is therefore christened
affinity. I cannot accept this view. Admitting
our inability to say <i>why</i> gases combine under certain conditions
(and in this sense all facts are inexplicable and
ultimate, unless we take the <i>how</i> as ample explanation of
the <i>why</i>), I must still say that since affinity itself depends
on the co-operation of known conditions, it is not less explicable
than combustion. But the point is unimportant:
what we have here to settle is the meaning of a property
of tissue,—and that is the mode of reaction which that
tissue manifests under constant conditions, internal and
external.</p>

<p>83. The evolution of Life is the evolution of special
properties and functions from general properties and functions.
The organism rises in power as it ramifies into
variety. Out of a seemingly structureless germinal membrane,
by successive differentiations certain portions are
set apart for the dominant, or exclusive, performance of
certain processes; just as in the social organism there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
a setting apart of certain classes of men for the dominant
or exclusive performance of offices, which by their
co-operation constitute Society. The soldier fights, but
ceases to build or reap, weave or teach; the mason builds;
the agriculturist sows and reaps; the priest and thinker
teach; the statesman governs. In simple societies each
does all, or nearly all; but the social life thus manifested
is markedly inferior to the energetic life of a complex
society. So with organisms. An amœba manifests the
general properties of Nutrition, Reproduction, Sensibility,
and Movement. But it has no special organs, consequently
no special functions. The polype has a certain
rudimentary specialization of parts: it has a simple alimentary
cavity, and prehensile tentacles; and although
by these it can seize and digest its prey, it can only do so
in a limited way—all the manifold varieties and power
of prehension and digestion observed in more complex
organisms are impossible with such organs as the polype
possesses.</p>

<p>84. Differences of structure and connection necessarily
bring about corresponding differences in Function, since
Function is the <i>directed energy</i> of the Properties of tissues.
One organ will differ from another in structure, as the
liver from the pancreas, or the kidney from the spleen;
or one organ may closely resemble another but differ from
it only in <i>connections</i>, as a sensory and a motor nerve, or an
extensor and a flexor muscle. We must therefore always
bear both points in mind. Every modification, structural
or connectional, is translated by a corresponding modification
in the office. The hand and the foot show this well.
The tissues are the same in both, the properties are the
same, and both have the same general function of Prehension;
but their morphological differences carry corresponding
differences in their uses.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a galvanic battery, we know that its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
electric force may be variously applied. Two pieces of
charcoal fixed to the ends of its conducting wires give us
the electric light; replacing the charcoal by a telegraphic
apparatus we can transmit a message from one continent
to the other; the wires dipped in a solution effect a chemical
decomposition, dipped into a mixture of gases they
effect a chemical composition. In these, and many other
applications, the property of the battery is constant; but
the functions it subserves have varied with the varying
co-operants. So with the properties of tissue.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Not only
have we to bear in mind the organic connections of the
tissues, but also the relation of the organs to their media.
Swimming and Walking, for example, are both functions
of the locomotive apparatus, but they are specially differenced
by the media in which the animal moves.</p>

<p>85. The properties of tissues are their peculiar modes
of reaction, and each tissue has its dominant characteristic,
such as the Contractility of the muscle, and the Neurility
of the nerve. But there has of late years sprung up
a misleading conception, partly a consequence of the cell-theory,
and partly of the almost inevitable tendency of
analysis to disregard whatever elements it provisionally
sets aside; this conception is the removal of the property
from its <i>tissue</i>, and the localization of it in one of the
<i>organites</i>—cell or fibre. This has been conspicuously
mischievous in the case of the nerve-cell, which has been
endowed with mysterious powers, and may be said to
have usurped the place of nerve-tissue. I shall have to
speak of this in the next problem. Here I only warn the
student against the common error. The properties of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
tissue depend on the structure and composition of that
tissue, together with its plasmode and products; they
vary as these vary. To select any one element in this
complex, and ascribe the reaction of the tissue to that, is
only permissible as a shorthand expression.</p>

<p>86. What has just been expounded may be condensed
in the following biological <span class="locked">law:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Identity of tissue everywhere implies identity of property;
and similarity of tissue corresponding similarity of property.
Identity of organic connection everywhere implies
identity of function; and similarity of organic connection
similarity of function.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>87. This law, first formulated by me in 1859, and then
applied to the interpretation of nervous functions, was so
little understood that for the most part it met with either
decided denial or silent neglect; no doubt because of the
general disinclination to admit that the properties and
functions of the spinal cord could be <i>similar</i> to those of
the brain, in correspondence with the similarity of their
tissues and organic connections. Even Professor Vulpian,
who adopted it, as well as my principal interpretations,
hesitated, and relapsed into the orthodox view in assigning
three different properties to one and the same tissue
in cord, medulla oblongata, and cerebrum.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> In the course
of our inquiries we shall so frequently have to invoke this
law that I earnestly beg the reader to meditate upon it,
and ask himself upon what other grounds, save those of
structure and connection, the properties and functions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
can possibly rest? If on no other, then similarity in
structure and connection by logical necessity involves
similarity in property and function.</p>

<h3 id="sec_8">DOES THE FUNCTION DETERMINE THE ORGAN?</h3>

<p id="I_88">88. Closely connected with this law, which simply
formulates the self-evident principle that <i>every action is
rigorously determined by the nature of the agent, and the
conditions under which the act takes place</i>, is the surprising
question whether functions are dependent upon organs,
or organs dependent on functions?—a question which
sometimes takes this shape: Is Life the result of organization,
or is organization the result of Life?</p>

<p>The vitalist, who holds that Life is an extra-organic
agent, is logical in declaring organization to be the consequence
of Life;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> but there are many organicists who
conclude from certain facts that organs are developed by
functions, and that organization is a result of Life. There
seems, however, to be some equivoque here. I cannot
otherwise understand how Mr. Spencer should have written:
“There is one fact implying that Function must
be regarded as taking the precedence of Structure. Of
the lowest rhizopods which present no distinctions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
parts, and nevertheless feed and grow and move about,
Professor Huxley has remarked that they exhibit Life
without Organization.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The equivoque here arises from
the practice of calling all living bodies “organisms,”
even those destitute of the differentiations called organs;
but if we substitute the term “living body” in lieu of
“organism,” the equivoque will disappear, and Function
no longer seem to precede Structure. Neither Mr. Spencer
nor Mr. Huxley would affirm that Life can be manifested
without a living body; and every living body
must have a structure of some sort—unless by structure
be meant a special configuration of parts. The properties
of a body, whether it be simple or complex in structure,
result from the properties of its components; and
the vital phenomena vary with these varying components.
The substance of a Rhizopod is indeed simple
as compared with that of higher organisms, but is complex
as compared with anorganisms; and corresponding
with this simplicity of structure there is simplicity of
vital function.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>89. The <i>properties</i> of steam are exhibited by the kettle
on the fire, no less than by the gigantic engine which
animates a manufactory; but the <i>uses</i> of steam (the
functions of the engine) vary with the varying structure,
and the applications of that structure to other structures.
Precisely analogous is the case of the organ and its function,
in relation to the living substance of which it is a
peculiar modification. Vital actions are manifested by
a lump of protoplasm; but these actions are as sharply
demarcated from the actions of more highly organized
animals, as the phenomena of a steam-engine are from
those of a teakettle.</p>

<p>90. Mr. Spencer has nowhere defined what he means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
by Structure, nor given a definition of Organ, and this
neglect makes it difficult rightly to appreciate his view.
But whether we take structure to signify the <i>substance</i>
of the living body, or the <i>differentiations</i> of that substance
into separate tissues and organs, in either case the
actions (functions) of which this structure is the agent
must be rigorously determined by it. Mr. Spencer has
avowed this in declaring that the “general physiologist
may consider functions in their widest sense as the correlatives
of tissue.” Is this true in the widest sense and
not true in the narrowest? I am puzzled to find him
insisting that “function from beginning to end is the
determining cause of structure. Not only is this manifestly
true where the modification of structure arises by
reaction from modification of function; but it is also
true where a modification of structure otherwise produced
apparently initiates a modification of function.” Such
language would be consistent were he a vitalist who
believed in a Principle independent of Matter which
shapes matter into organic forms; but as a positive
thinker he can scarcely escape the admission that since
Function is the activity of the Agent (Function in the
widest sense being the action of the whole Organism, and
in its narrowest sense the action of the special Organ)
there cannot be an <i>activity preceding the agent</i>. I suspect
that he does not always bear in mind the distinction
between Property and Function, and consequently is led
into statements at variance with the principles he professes.
As far as I understand the course of his thought,
it runs somewhat thus: With the increased use of an
organ its volume may be increased, its structure altered;
this alteration will, by reaction, cause alterations in other
organs, and thus the result of a change in the habitual
activities of an animal will be an alteration in the arrangement
of its parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
91. We speak loosely of an organ being developed by
increased activity; but this is loose speech, and investigation
shows that the organ is not developed <i>by</i>, but
accompanies the increased activity, every increment of
activity being necessarily preceded by a corresponding
increment of structure. This is evident <i>à priori</i>: the
force manifested is inherent in the structure manifesting
it. Thus we ought not to say “the vascular system furnishes
good instances of the increased growth that <i>follows</i>
increased function”; we ought to say, “that <i>permits</i> increased
function.” The muscle having a contractile power
represented by 10, expends, we will suppose, 7 units of
force in its normal activity, and these are replaced by its
normal nutrition. If from an extra demand upon it 9
units are expended, the muscle becomes fatigued, if 10,
exhausted, and it will no longer contract, the whole disposable
sum of its contractility being dissipated. During
all these stages the structure of the muscle—or to prevent
all equivoque, let us say the substance of the muscle—has
been changing, not indeed in any degree appreciable
to the eye, but appreciable by the more decisive tests
of chemical and physiological reactions. Yet inasmuch as
in the ordinary course of things the waste is quickly repaired,
the muscle in repose once more regains its original
state, once more represents 10 units of contractility.
Now let us consider what takes place when extra labor is
thrown upon the muscle, when exercise causes growth. At
the outset of a walking tour we may not be able to compass
more than twenty miles a day, at its close we manage
thirty. Is it the increased activity of the function which
has caused this increase of structure? In one sense, yes;
but let us understand it. Had the increase of activity
been temporary, there would have been only a temporary
increase of structure. But when the ordinary expenditure
of 7 units rises to 9, on several successive days, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
extra expenditure of tissue has had to be met by an extra
nutrition—i. e. more plasmode has been formed and
more protoplasm. It is a physiological law, easily explained,
that, within due limits, extra waste brings about
extra repair: as the channels are widened and multiplied,
the <i>derived</i> currents become stronger, and the increased
flow of nutrition which was temporary becomes permanent,
because this increase is no longer dependent on
an extra stimulus, but on an enlarged channel.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> When
the channels have not become multiplied or enlarged,
which must be the case whenever the extra stimulus is
fluctuating and temporary, the extra expenditure is not
followed by increased size of the muscle: the currents
resume their old directions, no longer being diverted.</p>

<p>92. Let the social organism furnish us with an illustration.
At the present moment there is a movement
against the retail shopkeepers of London in favor of Co-operative
Stores. The stimulus of getting better goods
and cheaper, attracts the flow of custom from its old channels;
and if this continue a certain time the new arrangements
will be so thoroughly organized, and will work so
easily, that Co-operative Stores will to a great extent supplant
the retail shops. But if from any causes the stimulus
slackens before this reorganization has passed from
the oscillating into the permanent stage—if the goods
are not found to be superior, or the cheapness not worth
the extra trouble—the old influences (aiding our indolence)
which have been long and continuously at work,
will cause the social organism to resume its old aspect,
and the co-operative “varieties” will disappear, or exist
beside the ancient “species.”</p>

<p>In the one case as in the other a glance at the process
is enough to detect that the increase in the activity has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
been preceded by a corresponding increase in the structure.
The muscle has not been enlarged <i>by</i> extra activity,
but <i>with</i> it. The co-operative action has grown with
each additional co-operator. Looking at the cases from
afar we may justly say that development has been due
to function; but looking to the process we see that each
increment of activity was necessarily dependent on an
increment of substance. When changes of habit or adaptation
are said to produce modifications in structures, this
is true in as far as one modification of structure necessarily
brings with it correlative modifications, the growth
of one part affecting the growth of all more or less; but
we must remember that to render the structure capable
of new adaptations corresponding modifications must have
been going on. The retail shopkeepers might securely
laugh at the co-operative movement if the respectable
families would not or could not become co-operant.
When Mr. Spencer urges that “not only may leaf-stalks
assume to a great degree the character of stems when
they have to discharge the functions of stems by supporting
many leaves, and very large leaves, but they may
assume the characters of leaves when they have to undertake
the functions of leaves,” I would ask if he is not
reversing the actual process? The stem cannot assume
the functions of a leaf until it has first assumed the character
of a leaf. The assumptions of both must be gradual,
and <i>pari passu</i>.</p>

<p>93. The hand is an organ, its function is prehension.
The performance of this function in any of its numerous
applications is rigorously limited by the structure of the
hand—the bones, muscles, nerves, circulating and absorbent
vessels, connective tissue, fat, etc. Fatigue the
nerve, and the function will be feebly performed; exhaust
it, and the function ceases; diminish the action of the
heart, tie an artery, or vitiate the structure of the blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and the function will be correspondingly affected; stiffen
the tendons, soften the bones, diminish the synovial fluid,
or increase the fat—in short, make <i>any</i> alteration whatever
in the structure of the hand, and an alteration is
necessarily produced in its function. So rigorously is
function dependent upon structure, that the hand of one
man will execute actions which are impossible to another.
The hand of a baby is said to be the same in structure as
the hand of a man; and since the powers (functions) of
the two are notoriously different, we might rashly conclude
that here function was dissociated from structure.
The case is illustrative. In baby and man the structure
is similar, not the same; the resemblance is of kind, not
of degree; and the function likewise varies with the degree.
The penny cannon which delights the child is similar
in structure to the ten-pounder which batters down
walls; and though, speaking generally, we may say that
the function of both is to fire gunpowder for human ends,
no one expects the penny cannon to be employed in warfare.
In physiology, as in mechanics, the effect varies
with the forces involved.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that an exaggerated activity will
produce a modification in the active organ, for this is only
the familiar case of increased growth with increased exercise,
and this is the biological meaning in which Function
can be said not, indeed, to <i>create</i>, but to <i>modify</i> an existing
Organ. Preceding the activity there must be the
agent. Every organ although having its special function
has also the properties of all the tissues which constitute
it. The function is only the synthesis of these properties
to which a dominant tissue gives a special character.
The eye, for example, though specially characterized by
its retinal sensibility to light, is largely endowed with
muscles, and its movements are essential to Vision. The
intestinal canal, again, though specially characterized by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
its secretions for the decomposition of food, has muscles
which are essential to Digestion. In many animals,
especially vegetable-feeders, there is an exaggeration of
the muscular activity in certain parts of the intestinal
canal which is only possible through a corresponding development
of the muscular tissue, so that in some birds,
crustaceans, and molluscs we find a gizzard, which is
wholly without a mucous membrane to secrete fluids, and
which aids Digestion solely by trituration.</p>

<p>94. Mr. Spencer, as I have already suggested, seems
to have been led into his view by not keeping distinctly
present to his mind the differences between Properties of
tissue and Function, the activity of an organ. “That
function takes precedence of structure,” he says, “seems
implied in the definition of Life. If Life consist of inner
actions so adjusted as to balance outer actions—if the
actions are the <i>substance</i> of Life, while the adjustment
constitutes its <i>form</i>; then may we not say that the actions
formed must come before that which forms them—that
the continuous change which is the basis of function
must come before the structure which brings the function
into shape?” The separation of “actions formed” from
“that which forms them” is inadmissible. An action
cannot come <i>before</i> the agent: it is the agent in act. The
continuous change, which is the basis of Vitality, is a
change of molecular arrangements; and the organ which
gives a special <i>direction</i> to the vital activity, e. g. which
shapes the property of Contractility into the function of
Prehension, this organ must itself be formed before it can
manifest this function. It is true that in one sense the
organs are formed by, or are differentiated in, a pre-existent
organism; true that the general activity of living substance
must precede the special activity of any organ, as
the expansions of steam must precede any steam-engine
action; but the general activity depends on the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
structure; and the special actions on the special structures.
If by Organization we are to understand not simply
organized substance, but a more or less complex
arrangement of that substance into separate organs, the
question is tantamount to asking whether the simplest
animals and plants have life? And to ask the question,
whether Life precedes organic substance? is tantamount
to asking whether the convex aspect of a curve precedes
the concave! or whether the motions of a body precede
the body! To disengage ourselves from the complicated
suggestions of such a word as Life, let us consider one of
the vital phenomena, Contraction. This is a phenomenon
manifested by simple protoplasm, and by the highly differentiated
form of protoplasm known as muscle. In one
sense it would be correct to say that Contractility as a
general property of tissue precedes Contraction, which is
specialized in muscle. But it would be absurd to say
that <i>muscular</i> contraction preceded the existence of muscle,
and formed it. The contractions of the protoplasm
are not the same as muscular contractions any more than
the hand of a baby is the same as a man’s; the general
property which both have in common depends on the
substance both have in common; the special property
which belongs to the muscle depends on its special structure.
An infinite activity of the contractile protoplasm
would be incompetent to form a muscle, unless it were
accompanied by that peculiar change in structure which
constitutes muscle. The teakettle might boil forever
without producing a steam-engine or the actions of a
steam-engine. That which is true of one function is true
of all functions, and true of Life, which is the sum of
vital activities.</p>

<p>95. It is this haziness which made Agassiz “regret to
observe that it has almost become an axiom that identical
functions presuppose identical organs. There never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
was a more incorrect principle leading to more injurious
consequences.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> And elsewhere he argues that organs
can exist without functions. But this is obviously to
pervert the fundamental idea of an organ. “The teeth
of the whale which never eat through the gums, and the
breasts of the males of all classes of mammalia,” are cited
by him as examples of such organs without functions;
but in the physiological significance of the term these are
not organs at all. It is no more to be expected that the
breasts of the male should act in lactation, than that the
slackened string of a violin should yield musical tones;
but the breasts of the male may be easily stimulated into
yielding milk, and the slackened string of the violin may
be tightened so as to yield tone. Even the breasts of the
female do not yield milk except under certain conditions,
and in the absence of these are on a par with those of the
male.</p>

<p>96. Organized substance has the general properties of
Assimilation, Evolution, Sensibility, and Contractility;
each of the special tissues into which organized substance
is differentiated manifests a predominance of one of these
properties. Thus although the embryo-cells all manifest
contractility, it is only the specialized muscle-cell which
continues throughout its existence to manifest this property,
and in a dominant form; the muscle-cell also assimilates
and develops, but besides having these properties in
common with all other cells, it has the special property
of contracting with an energy not found in the others.
All cells respire; but the blood-cells have this property
of absorbing oxygen to a degree so far surpassing that of
any other cell that physiologists have been led to speak
of their containing a peculiar respiratory substance. In
like manner all, or nearly all, the tissues contain <i>myeline</i>—which
indeed is one of the chief constituents of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
yolk of eggs—but only in the white sheath of the nerves
is it detached and specialized as a tissue.</p>

<p>97. But while Sensibility and Contractility are general
properties of organized substance, specialized in special
tissues; Sensation and Contraction are functions of the
organs formed by such tissues; and these organs are only
found in animal organisms. It is a serious error, which
we shall hereafter have to insist on, to suppose that Sensation
can be the property of ganglionic cells, or, as it is
more often stated, the property of the central gray matter.
Sensation is the function of the organism; it varies with
the varying organ; the sensation of Touch not being the
same as the sensation of Sight, or of Sound.</p>

<p>98. We may consider the organism under two aspects—that
of Structure and that of Function. The latter
has two broad divisions corresponding with the vegetal
and animal lives; the one is Nutrient, the other Efficient.
The one prepares and distributes Food, the other distributes
Motion. Of course this separation is analytical. In
reality the two are interblended; and although the neuro-muscular
system is developed out of the nutritive system,
it is no sooner developed than it plays its part as Instrument
in the preparation and distribution of Aliment.</p>

<p>This not being a treatise on Physiology, there can be no
necessity for our here considering the properties and functions
in detail. What is necessary to be said on Sensibility
and Contractility will find its place in the course
of future chapters; for the present we will confine ourselves
to Evolution on account of its psychological, no
less than its physiological, interest.</p>

<p>99. <span class="firstword">That</span> organized substance has the property of
nourishing itself by assimilating from its internal medium
substances there present in an unorganized state,
and that this is followed by a development or differentiation
of structure, is familiar to every inquirer.</p>

<p>Every one who has pursued embryological researches,
and in a lesser degree every one who has merely read
about them, must have been impressed by this marvel of
marvels: an exceedingly minute portion of living matter,
so simple in aspect that a line will define it, passes by
successive modifications into an organism so complex that
a treatise is needed to describe it; not only do the cells
in which the ovum and the spermatozoon originate, pass
into a complex organism, reproducing the forms and features
of the parents, and with these the constitutional
peculiarities of the parents (their longevity, their diseases,
their mental dispositions, nay, their very tricks and habits),
but they may reproduce the form and features, the
dispositions and diseases, of a grandfather or great-grandfather,
which had lain dormant in the father or mother.
Consider for an instant what this implies. A microscopic
cell of albuminous compounds, wholly without trace of
organs, not appreciably distinguishable from millions of
other cells, does nevertheless contain within it the “possibilities”
of an organism so complex and so special as
that of a Newton or a Napoleon. If ever there was a case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
when the famous Aristotelian notion of a “potential
existence” seemed justified, assuredly it is this. And
although we can only by a fallacy maintain the oak to be
<i>contained</i> in the acorn, or the animal contained in the
ovum, the fallacy is so natural, and indeed so difficult of
escape, that there is no ground for surprise when physiologists,
on first learning something of development, were
found maintaining that the perfect organism existed
already in the ovum, having all its lineaments in miniature,
and only growing into visible dimensions through
the successive stages of evolution.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The preformation
of the organism seemed an inevitable deduction from the
opinions once universal. It led to many strange, and
some absurd conclusions; among them, to the assertion
that the original germ of every species contained within
it all the countless individuals which in process of time
might issue from it; and this in no metaphysical “potential”
guise, but as actual boxed-up existences (<i>emboîtés</i>);
so that Adam and Eve were in the most literal sense progenitors
of the whole human race, and contained their
progeny already shaped within them, awaiting the great
accoucheur, time.</p>

<p>100. This was the celebrated “emboîtement” theory.
In spite of obvious objections it gained scientific acceptance,
because physiologists could not bring themselves to
believe that so marvellous a structure as that of a human
organism arose by a series of successive modifications, or
because they could not comprehend how it was built up,
part by part, into forms so closely resembling the parent-forms.
That many and plausible reasons pleaded in favor
of this opinion is evident in the fact that illustrious men
like Haller, Bonnet, Vallisneri, Swammerdamm, Réaumur,
and Cuvier, were its advocates; and if there is not a sigle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
physiologist of our day who accepts it, or who finds
any peculiar difficulty in following the demonstrations of
embryologists, how from the common starting-point of a
self-multiplying epithelial cell parts so diverse as hairs,
nails, hoofs, scales, feathers, crystalline lens, and secreting
glands may be evolved, or how from the homogeneous
germinal membrane the complex organism will arise, there
are very few among the scorners of the dead hypothesis
who seem capable of generalizing the principles which
have destroyed it, or can conceive that the laws of Evolution
apply as rigorously to the animal and vegetable
<i>kingdoms</i> as to the individual <i>organisms</i>. The illustrious
names of those who advocated the preformation hypothesis
may serve to check our servile submission to the
authorities so loudly proclaimed as advocates of the fixity
of species. The more because the two doctrines have a
common parentage. The one falls with the other, and no
array of authorities can arrest the fall. That the manifold
differentiations noticeable in a complex organism
should have been evolved from a membrane wholly destitute
of differences is a marvel, but a marvel which Science
has made intelligible. Yet the majority of those to
whom this has been made intelligible still find an impossibility
in admitting that the manifold forms of plant and
animal were successively evolved from equally simple
origins. They relinquish the hypothesis of preformation
in the one case, and cling to it in the other. Evolution,
demonstrable in the individual history, seems preposterous
in the history of the class. And thus is presented
the instructive spectacle of philosophers laughing
at the absurdities of “preformation,” and yet exerting all
their logic and rhetoric in defence of “creative fiats”—which
is simply the preformation hypothesis “writ
large.”</p>

<p>101. It would not be difficult to show that the doctrine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of Epigenesis, with which Wolff forever displaced
the doctrine of Preformation, leads by an inevitable logic
to the doctrine of universal Evolution; and that we can
no more understand the appearance of a new organism
which is not the modification of some already existing
organism, than we can understand the sudden appearance
of a new organ which is not the modification of some
existing structure. In the one case as in the other we
may disguise the process under such terms as creative
fiat and preformation; but these terms are no explanations;
they re-state the results, they do not describe the
process; whereas Epigenesis describes the process as it
passes under the eye of science.</p>

<p>102. If any reader of these pages who, from theological
or zoölogical suspicion of the Development Hypothesis,
clings to the hypothesis of a creative Plan which
once for all arranged the organic world in Types that
could not change, will ask what rational interpretation
can be given to the succession of phases each embryo is
forced to pass through, it may help to give him pause.
He will observe that <i>none</i> of these phases have any adaptation
to the future state of the animal, but are in positive
contradiction to it, or are simply purposeless; whereas
all show stamped on them the unmistakable characters
of <i>ancestral</i> adaptations and the progressions of Organic
Evolution. What does the fact imply? There is not a
single known example of a complex organism which is
not developed out of simpler forms. Before it can attain
the complex structure which distinguishes it, there must
be an evolution of forms similar to those which distinguish
the structures of organisms lower in the series.
On the hypothesis of a Plan which prearranged the organic
world, nothing could be more unworthy of a supreme
intelligence than this inability to construct an
organism at once, without previously making several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
tentative efforts, undoing to-day what was so carefully
done yesterday, and <i>repeating for centuries the same tentatives,
and the same corrections, in the same succession</i>.
Do not let us blink this consideration. There is a traditional
phrase much in vogue among the anthropomorphists,
which arose naturally enough from the tendency
to take human methods as an explanation of the divine—a
phrase which becomes a sort of argument—“The
Great Architect.” But if we are to admit the human
point of view, a glance at the facts of embryology must
produce very uncomfortable reflections. For what should
we say to an architect who was unable, or being able was
obstinately unwilling, to erect a palace except by first
using his materials in the shape of a hut, then pulling it
down and rebuilding them as a cottage, then adding story
to story and room to room, <i>not</i> with any reference to the
ultimate purposes of the palace, but wholly with reference
to the way in which houses were constructed in ancient
times? What should we say to the architect who could
not form a museum out of bricks and mortar, but was
forced to begin as if going to build a mansion: and after
proceeding some way in this direction, altered his plan
into a palace, and that again into a museum? Yet this
is the sort of succession on which organisms are constructed.
The fact has long been familiar; how has it
been reconciled with Infinite Wisdom? Let the following
passage answer for a thousand:—“The embryo is
nothing like the miniature of the adult. For a long
while the body in its entirety and its details presents
the strangest of spectacles. Day by day and hour by
hour the aspect of the scene changes, and this instability
is exhibited by the most essential parts no less than by
the accessory parts. One would say that Nature feels her
way, and only reaches the goal after many times missing
the path,—on dirait que la nature tâtonne et ne conduit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
son œuvre à bon fin qu’après s’être souvent trompée.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
Writers have no compunction in speaking of Nature feeling
her way and blundering; but if in lieu of Nature,
which may mean anything, the Great Architect be substituted,
it is probable that the repugnance to using such
language of evasion may cause men to revise their conceptions
altogether; they dare not attribute ignorance
and incompetence to the Creator.</p>

<p>103. Obviously the architectural hypothesis is incompetent
to explain the phenomena of organic development.
Evolution is the universal process; not creation of a
direct kind. Von Baer, who very properly corrected the
exaggerations which had been put forth respecting the
identity of the embryonic forms with adult forms lower
in the scale, who showed that the mammalian embryo
never was a bird, a reptile, or a fish, nevertheless emphasized
the fact that the mammalian embryo passes through
all the lower typical forms; so much so that, except by
their size, it is impossible to distinguish the embryos of
mammal, bird, lizard, or snake. “In my collection,” he
says, “there are two little embryos which I have omitted
to label, so that I am now quite incompetent to say to
what class they belong. They may be lizards, they may
be small birds, or very young mammals; so complete is
the similarity in the mode of formation of the head and
trunk. The extremities have not yet made their appearance.
But even if they existed in the earliest stage we
should learn nothing from them, for the feet of lizards,
mammals, and the wings of birds, all arise from the same
common form.” He sums up with his formula: “The
special type is always evolved from a more general
type.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Such reminiscences of earlier forms are intelligible on
the supposition that originally the later form was a modification
of the earlier form, and that this modification is
repeated; or on the supposition that there was a similarity
in the organic conditions, which similarity ceased at
the point where the new form emerged. But on no hypothesis
of creative Plan are they intelligible. They are
useless structures, failing even to subserve a temporary
purpose. Sometimes, as Mr. Darwin remarks, a trace of
the embryonic resemblance lasts till a late age: “Thus
birds of the same genus, and of closely allied genera,
often resemble each other in their first and second plumage:
as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush
group. In the cat tribe most of the species are striped
and spotted in lines; and stripes or spots can plainly be
distinguished in the whelp of the lion and the puma.
We occasionally, though rarely, see something of this
kind in plants.... The points of structure in which
the embryos of widely different animals of the same class
resemble each other often have no direct relation to their
conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance, suppose
that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like
courses of the arteries near the bronchial slits are related
to similar conditions in the young mammal which
is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of a
bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a
frog under water.”</p>

<p>104. It would be easy to multiply examples, but I
will content myself with three. The tadpole of the Salamander
has gills, and passes his existence in the water;
but the <i>Salamandra atra</i>, which lives high up among the
mountains, brings forth its young full-formed. This animal
never lives in the water. Yet if we open a gravid
female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely feathered
gills, and (as I have witnessed) these tadpoles “when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
from the mother’s womb untimely ripped,” if placed in
water, swim about like the tadpoles of water newts. Obviously
this aquatic organization has no reference to the
future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation to its
embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral
forms, it repeats a phase in the development of its progenitors.
Again, in the embryo of the naked Nudibranch,
we always observe a shell, although the animal is without
a shell, and there can be no purpose served by the shell
in embryonic life.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Finally, the human embryo has a
tail, which is of course utterly purposeless, and which,
although to be explained as a result of organic laws, is
on the creative hypothesis only explained as an adherence
to the general plan of structure—a specimen
of pedantic trifling “worthy of no intellect above the
pongo’s.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>105. Humanly appreciated, not only is it difficult to
justify the successive stages of development, the incessant
building up of structures immediately to be taken
down, but also to explain why development was necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
at all. Why are not plants and animals formed at once,
as Eve was mythically affirmed to be taken from Adam’s
rib, and Minerva from Jupiter’s head? The theory of
Evolution answers this question very simply; the theory
of Creation can only answer it by affirming that such was
the ordained plan. But the theory of Evolution not only
gives the simpler and more intelligible answer to this
question, it gives an answer to the further question which
leaves the theory of Creation no loophole except a sophism—namely,
why the formation of organisms is constantly
being frustrated or perverted? And, further, it
gives an explanation of the law noticed by Milne Edwards,
that Nature is as economical in her means as she
is prodigal in her variation of them: “On dirait qu’avant
de recourir à des ressources nouvelles elle a voulu épuiser,
en quelque sorte, chacun des procédés qu’elle avait mis
en jeu.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The applause bestowed on Nature for being
economical is a curious transference to Nature of human
necessities. Why, with a whole universe at her disposal,
should Nature be economical? Why must she always be
working in the same groove, and using but a few out of
the many substances at her command? Economy is a
virtue only in the poor. If Nature, in organic evolutions,
is restricted to a very few substances, and a very few
modes of combination, always creating new forms by
modification of the old, and apparently incapable of creating
an organism at once, this must imply an inherent
necessity which is very unlike the free choice that can
render economy a merit.</p>

<p>106. There may indeed be raised an objection to the
Development Hypothesis on the ground that if the complex
forms were all developed from the simpler forms, we
ought to trace the identities through all their stages. If
the fish developed into the reptile, the reptile into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
bird, and the bird into the mammal (which I, for one,
think questionable), we ought to find, it is urged, evidence
of this passage. And at one time it was asserted that the
evidence existed; but this has been disproved, and on
the disproof the opponents of Evolution take their stand.
Although I cannot feel much confidence in the idea of
such a passage from Type to Type, and although the passage,
if ever it occurred, must have occurred at so remote
a period as to leave no evidence more positive than inference,
I cannot but think the teaching of Embryology far
more favorable to it than to our opponents. Supposing, for
the sake of argument, that the passage did take place,
ought we to find the embryonic stages accurately reproducing
the permanent forms of lower types? Von Baer
thinks we ought; and lesser men may follow him without
reproach. But it seems to me that he starts from an
inadmissible assumption, namely, that the development
must necessarily be in a straight line rather than in a
multiplicity of divergent lines. “When we find the embryonic
condition,” he says, “differing from the adult, we
ought to find a corresponding condition somewhere in the
lower animals.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Not necessarily. We know that the
mental development of a civilized man passes through
the stages which the race passed through in the course of
its long history, and the psychology of the child reproduces
the psychology of the savage. But as this development
takes place under conditions in many respects different,
and as certain phases are hurried over, we do not
expect to find a complete parallel. It is enough if we
can trace general resemblances. Von Baer adds, “That
certain correspondences should occur between the embryonic
states of some animals and the adult states of others
seems inevitable and of no significance(?). They could
not fail, since the embryos lie within the animal sphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
and the variations of which the animal body is capable
are determined for each type by the internal connection
and mutual reaction of its organs, so that particular repetitions
are inevitable.” A profound remark, to which I
shall hereafter have occasion to return, but its bearing on
the present question is inconclusive. The fact that the
embryonic stages of the higher animals resemble in general
characters the permanent stages of the lower animals,
and very closely resemble the embryonic stages of those
animals, is all that the Development Hypothesis requires.
Nor is its value lessened by the fact that many of the
details and intermediate stages seem passed over in the
development of the higher forms, for the recapitulation
can only be of outlines, not of details; since there are
differences in the forms, there must be differences in
their histories.</p>

<p id="I_107">107. In the preceding observations the object has simply
been to show that the phenomena to be explained can
be rationally conceived as resulting from gradual Evolution,
whereas they cannot be so rationally interpreted on
any other hypothesis. And here it may be needful to say
a word respecting Epigenesis.</p>

<p>The Preformation hypothesis, which regarded every
organism as a simple educt and not the product of a germ,
was called by its advocates an evolution hypothesis—meaning
that the adult form was an outgrowth of the
germ, the miniature magnified. Wolff, who replaced that
conception by a truer one, called his, by contrast, Epigenesis,
meaning that there was not simply <i>out</i>-growth but
<i>new</i> growth. “The various parts,” he says, “arise one
<i>after</i> the other, so that always one is secreted from (<i>excernirt</i>),
or deposited (<i>deponirt</i>) on the other; and then it is
either a free and independent part, or is only fixed to that
which gave it existence, or else is contained within it.
So that <i>every part is the effect of a pre-existing part, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
turn the cause of a succeeding part</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The last sentence
expresses the conception of Epigenesis which embryologists
now adopt; and having said this, we may admit that
Wolff, in combating the error of preformation, replacing
it with the truer notion of gradual and successive formation,
was occasionally open to the criticism made by Von
Baer, that he missed the true sense of Evolution, since
the new parts are not <i>added on</i> to the old parts as new
formations, but <i>evolved from</i> them as transformations.
“The word Evolution, therefore, seems to me more descriptive
of the process than Epigenesis. It is true that
the organism is not preformed, but the course of its development
is precisely the course which its parents formerly
passed through. Thus it is the Invisible—the course of
development—which is predetermined.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> When the
word Epigenesis is used, therefore, the reader will understand
it to signify that necessary succession which determines
the existence of new forms. Just as the formation of
chalk is not the indifferent product of any combination of
its elements, carbon, oxygen, and calcium, but is the product
of only one series of combinations, an evolution through
necessary successions, the carbon uniting with oxygen to
form carbonic acid, and this combining with the oxide of
calcium to form chalk, so likewise the formation of a
muscle, a bone, a limb, or a joint has its successive stages,
each of which is necessary, none of which can be transposed.
The formation of bone is peculiarly instructive,
because the large proportion of inorganic matter in its
substance, and seemingly deposited in the organic tissue,
would lead one to suppose that it was almost an accidental
formation, which might take place anywhere; yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
although what is called connective tissue will ossify under
certain conditions, true bone is the product of a very peculiar
modification, which almost always needs to be preceded
by cartilage. That the formation of bone has its
special history may be seen in the fact that it is the last
to appear in the animal series, many highly organized
fishes being without it, and all the other systems appearing
before it in the development of the embryo. Thus
although the mother’s blood furnishes all the requisite
material, the fœtus is incapable of assimilating this material
and of forming bone, until its own development has
reached a certain stage. Moreover, when ossification does
begin, it generally begins in the skull (in man in the clavicle);
and the only approach to an internal skeleton in
the Invertebrates is the so-called skull of the Cephalopoda.
Not only is bone a late development, but cartilage
is also; and although it is an error to maintain that the
Invertebrates are wholly destitute of cartilage, its occasional
presence having been fully proved by Claparède
and Gegenbaur, the rarity of its presence is very significant.
The animals which can form shells of chalk and
chitine are yet incapable of forming even an approach
to bone.</p>

<p>108. Epigenesis depends on the laws of succession,
which may be likened to the laws of crystallization, if we
bear in mind the essential differences between a crystal
and an organism, the latter retaining its individuality
through an incessant molecular change, the former only
by the exclusion of all change. When a crystalline solution
takes shape, it will always take a definite shape,
which represents what may be called the <i>direction</i> of its
forces, the polarity of its constituent molecules. In
like manner, when an organic plasmode takes shape—crystallizes,
so to speak—it always assumes a specific
shape dependent on the polarity of its molecules. Crystallographers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
have determined the several forms possible
to crystals; histologists have recorded the several forms
of Organites, Tissues, and Organs. Owing to the greater
variety in elementary composition, there is in organic
substance a more various polar distribution than in crystals;
nevertheless, there are sharply defined limits never
overstepped, and these constitute what may be called the
specific forms of Organites, Tissues, Organs, Organisms.
An epithelial cell, for example, may be ciliated or columnar,
a muscle-fibre striated or non-striated, a nerve-fibre
naked or enveloped in a sheath, but the kind is always
sharply defined. An intestinal tube may be a uniform
canal, or a canal differentiated into several unlike compartments,
with several unlike glandular appendages. A
spinal column may be a uniform solid axis, or a highly
diversified segmented axis. A limb may be an arm, or
a leg, a wing, or a paddle. In every case the anatomist
recognizes a specific type. He assigns the uniformities to
the uniformity of the substance thus variously shaped,
under a history which has been similar; the diversities
he assigns to the various conditions under which the processes
of growth have been determined. He never
expects a muscular tissue to develop into a skeleton, a
nervous tissue into a gland, an osseous tissue into a sensory
organ. He never expects a tail to become a hand or
a foot, though he sees it in monkeys and marsupials serving
the offices of prehension and locomotion. He never
expects to find fingers growing anywhere except from
metacarpal bones, or an arm developed from a skull. The
well-known generalization of Geoffroy St. Hilaire that an
organ is more easily annihilated than transposed, points
to the fundamental law of Epigenesis. In the same
direction point all the facts of growth. Out of a formless
germinal membrane we see an immense variety of forms
evolved; and out of a common nutritive fluid this variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
of organs is sustained, repaired, replaced; and this not
indifferently, not casually, but according to rigorous laws
of succession; that which precedes determining that
which succeeds as inevitably as youth precedes maturity,
and maturity decay. The nourishment of various organs
from plasmodes derived from a common fluid, each selecting
from that fluid only those molecules that are like its
own, rejecting all the rest, is very similar to the formation
of various crystals in a solution of different salts, each
salt separating from the solution only those molecules
that are like itself. Reil long ago called attention to this
analogy. He observed that if in a solution of nitre and
sulphate of soda a crystal of nitre be dropped, all the dissolved
nitre crystallizes, the sulphate remaining in solution;
whereas on reversing the experiment, a crystal of
sulphate of soda is found to crystallize all the dissolved
sulphate, leaving the nitre undisturbed. In like manner
muscle selects from the blood its own materials which are
there in solution, rejecting those which the nerve will
select.</p>

<p>109. Nay, so definite is the course of growth, that when
a limb or part of a limb is cut off from a crab or salamander,
a new limb or new part is reproduced in the old spot,
exactly like the one removed. Bonnet startled the world
by the announcement that the <i>Naïs</i>, a worm common in
ponds, spontaneously divided itself into two worms; and
that when he cut it into several pieces, each piece reproduced
head and tail, and grew into a perfect worm. This
had been accepted by all naturalists without demur, until
Dr. Williams, in his “Report on British Annelida, 1851,”
declared it to be a fable. In 1858, under the impulse of
Dr. Williams’s very emphatic denial, I repeated experiments
similar to those of Bonnet, with similar results. I
cut two worms in half, and threw away the head-bearing
segments, placing the others in two separate vessels, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
nothing but water and a little mud, which was first carefully
inspected to see that no worm lay concealed therein.
In a few days the heads were completely reformed, and I
had the pleasure of watching them during their reconstruction.
When the worms were quite perfect, I again
cut away their heads, and again saw these reformed. This
was repeated, till I had seen four heads reproduced; after
which the worms succumbed.</p>

<p id="I_110">110. The question naturally arises, Why does the nutritive
fluid furnish only material which is formed into a
part like the old one, instead of reproducing another part,
or one having a somewhat different structure? The answer
to this question is the key to the chief problem of
organic life. That a limb <i>in situ</i> should replace its molecular
waste by molecules derived from the blood, seems
intelligible enough (because we are familiar with it), and
may be likened to the formation of crystals in a solution;
but how is it that the limb <i>which is not in existence</i> can
assimilate materials from the blood? How is it that the
blood, which elsewhere in the organism will form other
parts, here will only form this particular part? There is,
probably, no one who has turned his attention to these
subjects who has not paused to consider this mystery.
The most accredited answer at present before the world is
one so metaphysiological that I should pass it by, were
it not intimately allied with that conception of Species,
which it is the object of these pages to root out. It
is this:</p>

<p>111. The organism is determined by its Type, or, as
the Germans say, its Idea. All its parts take shape
according to this ruling plan; consequently, when any
part is removed, it is reproduced according to the Idea of
the whole of which it forms a part. Milne Edwards, in
a very interesting and suggestive work, concludes his survey
of organic phenomena in these words: “Dans l’organisme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
tout semble calculé en vue d’un résultat déterminé,
et l’harmonie des parties ne résulte pas de l’influence
qu’elles peuvent exercer les unes sur les autres, mais de
leur co-ordination sous l’empire d’une puissance commune,
d’un plan préconçu, d’une force pré-existante.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This is
eminently metaphysiological. It refuses to acknowledge
the operation of immanent properties, refuses to admit
that the harmony of a complex structure results from the
mutual relations of its parts, and seeks <i>outside</i> the organism
for some mysterious force, some plan, not otherwise
specified, which regulates and shapes the parts. Von
Baer, in his great work, has a section entitled, “The nature
of the animal determines its development”; and he
thus explains himself: “Although every stage in development
is only made possible by the pre-existing condition
[which is another mode of expressing Epigenesis],
nevertheless the entire development is ruled and guided
by the Nature of the animal which is about to be (von
der gesammten Wesenheit des Thieres welches werden
soll), and it is not the momentary condition which alone
and absolutely determines the future, but more general
and higher relations.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> One must always be slow in
rejecting the thoughts of a master, and feel sure that one
sees the source of the error before regarding it as an error;
but in the present case I think the positive biologist will
be at no loss to assign Von Baer’s error to its metaphysical
origin. Without pausing here to accumulate examples
both of anomalies and slighter deviations which are
demonstrably due to the “momentary conditions” that
preceded them, let us simply note the logical inconsistency
of a position which, while assuming that <i>every separate
stage</i> in development is the necessary sequence of its
predecessor, declares the <i>whole of the stages</i> independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of such relations! Such a position is indeed reconcilable
on the assumption that animal forms are moulded “like
clay in the hands of the potter.” But this is a theological
dogma, which leads to very preposterous and impious
conclusions; and whether it leads to these conclusions or
to others, positive Biology declines theological explanations
altogether. Von Baer, although he held the doctrine
of Epigenesis, coupled it, as many others have done, with
metaphysical doctrines to which it is radically opposed.
He believed in Types as realities; he was therefore consistent
in saying, “It is not the Matter and its arrangements
which determine the product, but the nature of the
parent form—the Idea, according to the new school.”
How are we to understand this Idea? If it mean an
independent Entity, an agency external to the organism,
we refuse to acknowledge its existence. If it mean only
an <i>a posteriori</i> abstraction expressing the totality of the
conditions, then, indeed, we acknowledge that it determines
the animal form; but this is only an abbreviated
way of expressing the law of Evolution, by which each
stage determines its successor. The Type does not <i>dominate</i>
the conditions, it <i>emerges</i> from them; the animal
organism is not cast in a mould, but the imaginary mould
is the form which the polarities of the organic substance
assume. It would seem very absurd to suppose that crystals
assumed their definite shapes (when the liquid which
held their molecules in solution is evaporated) under the
determining impulse of phantom-crystals, or Ideas; yet
it has not been thought absurd to assume phantom forms
of organisms.</p>

<p>112. The conception of Type as a determining influence
arises from that fallacy of taking a resultant for a
principle, which has played so conspicuous a part in the
history of philosophy. Like many others of its class it
exhibits an interesting evolution from the crude metaphysical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
to the subtle metaphysical point of view, which
at last insensibly blends into the positive point of view.
At first the Type or Idea was regarded as an objective
reality, external to the organism it was supposed to rule.
Then this notion was replaced by an approach to the
more rational interpretation, the idea was made an internal
not an external force, and was incorporated with the
material elements of the organism, which were said to
“endeavor” to arrange themselves according to the Type.
Thus Treviranus declares that the seed “dreams of the
future flower”; and “Henle, when he affirms that hair
and nails grow in virtue of the Idea, is forced to add that
the parts endeavor to arrange themselves according to
this Idea.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Even Lotze, who has argued so victoriously
against the vitalists, and has made it clear that an organism
is a vital mechanism, cannot relinquish this conception
of legislative Ideas, though he significantly adds,
“these have no power in themselves, but only in as far
as they are grounded in mechanical conditions.” Why
then superfluously add them to the conditions? If every
part of a watch, in virtue of the properties inherent in
its substance, and of the mutual reactions of these and
other parts, has a mechanical value, and if the sum of
all these parts is the time-indicating mechanism, do we
add to our knowledge of the watch, and our means of
repairing or improving it, by assuming that the parts
have over and above their physical properties the metaphysical
“tendency” or “desire” to arrange themselves
into this specific form? When we see that an organism
is constructed of various parts, each of which has its own
properties inalienable from its structure, and its uses
dependent on its relation to other parts, do we gain any
larger insight by crediting these parts with desires or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
“dreams” of a future result which their union will
effect? That which is true in this conception of legislative
Ideas is that when the parts come together there
is mutual reaction, and the resultant of the whole is
something very unlike the mere addition of the items,
just as water is very unlike oxygen or hydrogen; further,
the connexus of the whole impresses a peculiar
direction on the development of the parts, and the law
of Epigenesis necessitates a serial development, which
may easily be interpreted as due to a preordained
plan.</p>

<p id="I_113">113. In a word, this conception of Type only adds a
new name to the old difficulty, adding mist to darkness.
The law of Epigenesis, which is simply the expression of
the material process determined by the polarity of molecules,
explains as much of the phenomena as is explicable.
A lost limb is replaced by the very processes, and
through the same progressive stages as those which originally
produced it. We have a demonstration of its not
being reformed according to any Idea or Type which
exists apart from the immanent properties of the organic
molecules, in the fact that it is not reformed at once, but
by gradual evolution; the mass of cells at the stump are
cells of embryonic character, cells such as those which
originally “crystallized” into muscles, nerves, vessels,
and integument, and each cell passes through all its ordinary
stages of development. It is to be remembered
that so intimately dependent is the result on the determining
conditions, that any external influence which
disturbs the normal course of development will either
produce an anomaly, or frustrate the formation of a new
limb altogether. One of my tritons bit off the leg of his
female;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> the leg which replaced it was much malformed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
and curled over the back so as to be useless; was this
according to the Idea? I cut it off, and examined it;
all the bones were present, but the humerus was twisted,
and of small size. In a few weeks a new leg was developed,
and this leg was normal. If the Idea, as a ruling
power, determined the growth of this third leg, what
determined the second, which was malformed? Are we
to suppose that in normal growth the Idea prevails, in
abnormal the conditions? That it is the polarity of the
molecules which at each moment determines the group
those molecules will assume, is well seen in the experiment
of Lavalle mentioned by Bronn.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> He showed that
if when an octohedral crystal is forming, an angle be cut
away, so as to produce an artificial surface, a similar
surface is produced spontaneously on the corresponding
angle, whereas all the other angles are sharply defined.
“Valentin,” says Mr. Darwin, “injured the caudal extremity
of an embryo, and three days afterwards it produced
rudiments of a double pelvis, and of double hind
limbs. Hunter and others have observed lizards with
their tails reproduced and doubled. When Bonnet divided
longitudinally the foot of the salamander, several
additional digits were occasionally formed.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Where is
the evidence of the Idea in these cases?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
114. I repeat, the reproduction of lost limbs is due to
a process which is in all essential respects the same as
that which originally produced them; the genesis of one
group of cells is the necessary condition for the genesis
of its successor, nor can this order be transposed. But—and
the point is very important—it is not every part
that can be reproduced, nor is it every animal that has
reproductive powers. The worm, or the mollusk, seems
capable of reproducing every part; the crab will reproduce
its claws, but not its head or tail; the perfect insect
of the higher orders will reproduce no part (indeed the
amputation of its antennae only is fatal), the salamander
will reproduce its leg, the frog not. In human beings a
muscle is said never to be reproduced; but this is not the
case in the rare examples of supplementary fingers and toes,
which have been known to grow again after amputation.
The explanation of this difference in the reproductive
powers of different animals is usually assigned to the degree
in which their organisms retain the embryonic condition;
and this explanation is made plausible by the fact
that the animals which when adult have no power of
replacing lost limbs, have the power when in the larval
state. But although this may in some cases be the true
explanation, there are many in which it fails, as will be
acknowledged after a survey of the extremely various
organisms at widely different parts of the animal series
which possess the reproductive power. Even animals in
the same class, and at the same stage of development, differ
in this respect. I do not attach much importance to
the fact that all my experiments on marine annelids
failed to furnish evidence of their power of reproducing
lost segments; because it is difficult to keep them under
conditions similar to those in which they live. But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
significant that, among the hundreds which have passed
under my observation, not one should have been found
with a head-segment in the process of development, replacing
one that had been destroyed; and this is all the
more remarkable from the great tenacity of life which the
mutilated segments manifest. Quatrefages had observed
portions of a worm, after gangrene had destroyed its head
and several segments, move about in the water and avoid
the light!<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>115. A final argument to show that the reproduction
is not determined by any ruling Idea, but by the organic
conditions and the necessary stages of evolution, is seen
in the reappearance of a tumor or cancer after it has been
removed. We find the new tissue appear with all the
characters of the normal tissue of the gland, then rapidly
assume one by one the characters of the diseased tissue
which had been removed; and there as on is, that the regeneration
of the tissue is accompanied by the same abnormal
conditions which formerly gave rise to the tumor: the
directions of “crystallization” are similar because the conditions
are similar. In every case of growth or regrowth
the conditions being the same, the result must be the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
116. It seems a truism to insist that similarity in the
results must be due to similarity in the conditions; yet
it is one which many theorists disregard; and especially
do we need to bear it in mind when arguing about Species.
I will here only touch on the suggestive topic of
the analogies observed not simply among animals at the
extreme ends of the scale, but also between animals and
plants where the idea of a direct kinship is out of the
question.</p>

<p>My very imperfect zoölogical knowledge will not allow
me to adduce a long array of instances, but such an array
will assuredly occur to every well-stored mind. It is
enough to point to the many analogies of Function, more
especially in the reproductive processes—to the existence
of burrowers, waders, flyers, swimmers in various
classes—to the existence of predatory mammals, predatory
birds, predatory reptiles, predatory insects by the side
of herbivorous congeners,—to the nest-building and
incubating fishes; and in the matter of Structure the
analogies are even more illustrative when we consider
the widely diffused spicula, setæ, spines, hooks, tentacles,
beaks, feathery forms, nettling-organs, poison-sacs, luminous
organs, etc.; because these have the obvious impress
of being due to a community of substance under similar
conditions rather than to a community of kinship. The
beak of the tadpole, the cephalopod, the male salmon, and
the bird, are no doubt in many respects unlike; but there
is a significant likeness among them, which constitutes a
true analogy. I think there is such an analogy between
the air-bladder of fishes and the tracheal rudiment which
is found in the gnat-larva (<i>Corethra plumicornis</i>).<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
remarkable also is the resemblance of the <i>avicularium</i>,
or “bird’s-head process,” on the polyzoon known popularly
as the Corkscrew Coralline (<i>Bugula avicularia</i>),
which presents us in miniature with a vulture’s head—two
mandibles, one fixed, the other moved by muscles
visible within the head. No one can watch this organ
snapping incessantly, without being reminded of a vulture,
yet no one would suppose for a moment that the
resemblance has anything to do with kinship.</p>

<p>117. Such cases are commonly robbed of their due
significance by being dismissed as coincidences. But
what determines the coincidence? If we assume, as we
are justified in assuming, that the <i>possible directions</i> of
Organic Combination, and the resultant forms, are limited,
there must inevitably occur such coincident lines:
the hooks on a Climbing Plant will resemble the hooks
on a Crustacean or the claws of a Bird, as the one form
in which under similar external forces the more solid but
not massive portions of the integument tend to develop.
I am too ill acquainted with the anatomy of plants to say
how the hooks so common among them arise; but from
examination of the Blackberry, and comparison of its
thorns with the hooks and spines of the Crustacea, I am
led to infer that in each case the mode of development
is identical—namely, the secretion of chitine from the
cellular matrix of the integument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Another mode of evading the real significance of such
resemblances is to call them analogies, not homologies.
There is an advantage in having two such terms, but we
ought to be very clear as to their meaning and their point
of separation. Analogy is used to designate similarity in
Function with dissimilarity in Structure. The wing of
an insect, the wing of a bird, and the wing of a bat are
called analogous, but not homologous, because their anatomical
structure is different: they are not constructed
out of similar anatomical parts. The fore-leg of a mammal,
the wing of a bird, or the paddle of a whale, are
called homologous, because in spite of their diverse uses
they are constructed out of corresponding anatomical
parts. To the anatomist such distinctions are eminently
serviceable. But they have led to some misconceptions,
because they are connected with a profound misconception
of the relation between Function and Organ. Embryology
teaches that the wing of the bird and the paddle
of the whale are developed out of corresponding parts,
and that these are not like the parts from which the wing
of an insect or the flying-fish will be developed; nevertheless,
the most cursory inspection reveals that the wing
of a bird and the paddle of a whale are very unlike in
structure no less than in function, and that their diversities
in function correspond with their diversities in structure;
whereas the wing of the insect, of the bird, and of
the bat, are in certain characters very similar, and correspondingly
there are similarities in their function. It is,
however, obvious that the resemblance in function is
strictly limited to the resemblance in anatomical structure;
only in loose ordinary speech can the flight of an
insect, a bird, or a bat be said to be “the same”: it is different
in each—the weight to be moved, the rapidity of
the movement, the precision of the movements, and their
endurance, all differ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_9">NATURAL SELECTION AND ORGANIC AFFINITY.</h3>

<p id="I_118">118. It is impossible to treat of Evolution without
taking notice of that luminous hypothesis by which Mr.
Darwin has revolutionized Zoölogy. There are two points
needful to be clearly apprehended before the question is
entered upon. The first point relates to the lax use of
the phrase “conditions,” sometimes more instructively
replaced by “conditions of existence.” Inasmuch as Life
is only possible under definite relations of the organism
and its medium, the “conditions of existence” will be
those physical, chemical, and physiological changes, which
<i>in</i> the organism, and <i>out</i> of it, <i>co-operate</i> to produce the
result. There are myriads of changes in the external
medium which have no corresponding changes in the
organism, not being in any direct relation to it (see § <a href="#I_54">54</a>).
These, not being co-operant conditions, must be left out
of the account; they are not conditions of existence for
the organism, and therefore the organism does not vary
with their variations. On the other hand, what seem
very slight changes in the medium are often responded to
by important changes in the vital chemistry, and consequently
in the structure of the organism. Now the
nature of the organism at the time being, that is to say,
its structure and the physico-chemical state of its tissues
and plasmodes, is the main <i>condition</i> of this response;
the same external agent will be powerful, or powerless,
over slightly different organisms, or over the same organism
at different times. Usually, and for convenience,
when biologists speak of conditions, they only refer to
external changes. This usage has been the source of no
little confusion in discussing the Development Hypothesis.
Mr. Darwin, however, while following the established
usage, is careful in several places to declare that
of the two factors in Variation—the nature of the organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
and the nature of the conditions—the former is by
far the more important.</p>

<p>118<i>a</i>. A still greater modification of terms must now
be made. Instead of confining the “struggle for existence”
to the competition of rivals and the antagonism
of foes, we must extend it to the competition and antagonism
of tissues and organs. The existence of an
organism is not only dependent on the external existence
of others, and is the outcome of a struggle; but also on
the internal conditions which co-operate in the formation
of its structure, this structure being the outcome of a
struggle. The organism is this <i>particular</i> organism, differing
from others, because of the particular conditions
which have co-operated. The primary and fundamental
struggle must be that of the organic forces at work in
creating a structure capable of pushing its way amid
external forces. The organism must find a footing in the
world, before it can compete with rivals, and defend
itself against foes. Owing to the power of reproduction,
every organism has a potential indefiniteness of multiplication;
that potential indefiniteness is, however, in
reality restricted by the supply of food, and by the competition
of rivals for that supply. The multiplication
of any one species is thus kept down by the presence of
rivals and foes: a balance is reached, which permits of
the restricted quantities of various species. This balance
is the result of a struggle.</p>

<p>Now let me call attention to a similar process in the
formation of the organism itself. Every organite, and
every tissue, has a potential growth of indefinite extent,
but its real growth is rigorously limited by the competition
and antagonism of the others, each of which has
its potential indefiniteness, and its real limits. Something,
in the food assimilated, slightly alters the part
which assimilates it. This change may be the origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
other changes in the part itself, or in neighboring parts,
stimulating or arresting the vital processes. A modification
of structure results. Or there may be no new substance
assimilated, but external forces may call a part
into increased activity—which means increased waste
and repair; and this increase here is the cause of a
corresponding decrease somewhere else. Whatever the
nature of the change, it finds its place amid a complex
of changes, and its results are compounded with theirs.
When organites and tissues are said to have a potential
indefiniteness of growth, there is assumed a potential
indefiniteness in the pabulum supplied: <i>if</i> the pabulum
were supplied, and <i>if</i> there were no antagonism thwarting
its assimilation, growth would of course continue
without pause, or end; but in reality this cannot be so.
For, take the blood as the vehicle of the pabulum—not
only is its quantity limited, and partly limited by the
very action of the tissues it feeds, but even in any given
quantity there is a limit to its composition—it will only
take up a limited quantity of salts, iron, albumen, etc.;
no matter how abundant these may be in the food. So
again with the plasmodes of the various tissues—they
have each their definite capacities of assimilation. What
has already been stated respecting chemical affinity (§ <a href="#I_20">20</a>)
is equally applicable to organic affinity; as the presence
of fused iron in the crucible partially obstructs the combination
of sulphur and lead, so the presence of connective
tissue partially obstructs the combination of muscle
protoplasm with its pabulum.</p>

<p>118 <i>b</i>. Owing to the action and reaction of blood and
plasmode, of tissues on tissues, and organs on organs,
and their mutual limitations, the growth of each organism
has a limit, and the growth of each organ has a limit.
Beyond this limit, no extra supply of food will increase
the size of the organism; no increase of activity will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
increase the organ. “Man cannot add a cubit to his
stature.” The blacksmith’s arm will not grow larger by
twenty years of daily exercise, after it has once attained
a certain size. Increase of activity caused it to enlarge
up to this limit; but no increase of activity will cause it
to pass this limit. Why? Because here a balance of the
co-operating formative forces has been reached. Larger
muscles, or more muscle-fibres, demand arteries of larger
calibre, and these a heart of larger size; with the increase
of muscle would come increase of connective tissue; and
this tissue would not only compete with the muscle for
pabulum, but by mechanical pressure would diminish the
flow of that pabulum. And why would connective tissue
increase? Because, in the first place, there is a formative
association between the two, so that owing to a law,
not yet understood, the one always accompanies the
other; and, in the second place, there is a functional association
between the two, a muscle-fibre being <i>inoperative</i>
unless it be attached to a tendon, or connective
tissue; it will contract <i>out</i> of the body although separated
from its tendon or other attachment; but <i>in</i> the
body its contraction would be useless without this attachment.
We must bear in mind that muscle-fibres are
very much shorter than ordinary muscles; according to
the measurements of W. Krause they never exceed 4 <i>cm</i>
in length, and usually range between 2 and 3 <i>cm</i>; their
fine points being fixed to the interstitial connective tissue,
as the whole muscle is fixed to its tendon. The function
of the muscle is thus dependent on a due balance of its
component tissues; if that balance is disturbed the function
is disturbed. Should, from any cause, an excess of
muscle-fibre arise, the balance would be disturbed; should
an encroachment of connective tissue, or of fat, take
place, there would be also a defect of function.</p>

<p>Here we have the co-operation and limitation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
tissues illustrated; let us extend our glance, and we shall
see how the co-operation and limitation of the organs
come into play, so that the resulting function depends on
the balance of their forces. The contractile power of
each individual muscle is always limited by the resistance
of antagonists, which prevent the muscle being contracted
more than about a third of its <i>possible</i> extent, i. e. possible
when there are no resistances to be overcome. Not
only the increasing tension of antagonist muscles, but the
resistance of tendons, bones, and softer parts must be
taken into account. Thus, the increase of the blacksmith’s
muscular power would involve a considerable increase
in all the tissues of the arm; but such an increase
would involve a reconstruction of his whole organism.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an encroachment of one tissue on
another, there is a disturbance of the normal balance,
which readily passes into a pathological state. If the
brain is overrun with connective tissue, or the heart with
fatty tissue, we know the consequences. If connective
tissue is deficient, epithelial runs to excess, no longer limited
by its normal antagonist, and pus, or cancer, result.</p>

<p>118<i>c</i>. It is unnecessary here to enlarge on this point.
I have adduced it to show that we must extend our conception
of the struggle for existence beyond that of the
competition and antagonism of organisms—the external
struggle; and include under it the competition and antagonism
of tissues and organs—the internal struggle. Variability
is inherent in organic substances, as the result
of their indefiniteness of composition (§ <a href="#I_45b">45<i>b</i></a>). This variability
is indefinite, and is rendered definite by the competition
and antagonism, so that every particular variation
is the resultant of a composition of forces. The forces in
operation are the internal and external conditions of existence—i. e.
the nature of the organism, and its response
to the actions of its medium. A change may take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
in the medium without a corresponding response from the
organism; or the change may find a response and the
organism become modified. Every modification is a selection,
determined by laws of growth; it is the resultant
of a struggle between what, for want of a better term,
may be called the <i>organic affinities</i>—which represent in
organized substances what chemical affinities are in the
anorganized. Just as an organism which has been modified
and thereby gained a superiority over others, has by
this modification been <i>selected</i> for survival—the selection
being only another aspect of this modification—so one
tissue, or one organ, which has surpassed another in the
struggle of growth, will thereby have become selected.
Natural Selection, or survival of the fittest, therefore, is
simply the metaphorical expression of the fact that any
balance of the forces which is best adapted for survival
will survive. Unless we interpret it as a shorthand expression
of <i>all</i> the internal and external conditions of
existence, it is not acceptable as the origin of species.</p>

<p>118<i>d</i>. Mr. Darwin has so patiently and profoundly
meditated on the whole subject, that we must be very
slow in presuming him to have overlooked any important
point. I know that he has not altogether overlooked this
which we are now considering; but he is so preoccupied
with the tracing out of his splendid discovery in all its
bearings, that he has thrown the emphasis mainly on the
external struggle, neglecting the internal struggle; and has
thus in many passages employed language which implies
a radical distinction where—as I conceive—no such
distinction can be recognized. “Natural Selection,” he
says, “depends on the survival under various and complex
circumstances of the best-fitted individuals, but has no
relation whatever to the primary cause of any modification
of structure.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> On this we may remark, first, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
selection does not <i>depend</i> on the survival, but <i>is</i> that survival;
secondly, that the best-fitted individual survives
because of that modification of its structure which has
given it the superiority; therefore if the primary cause
of this modification is not due to selection, then selection
cannot be the cause of species. He separates Natural
Selection from all the primary causes of variation, either
internal or external—either as results of the laws of
growth, of the correlations of variation, of use and disuse,
etc., and limits it to the slow accumulations of such variations
as are profitable in the struggle with competitors.
And for his purpose this separation is necessary. But
biological philosophy must, I think, regard the distinction
as artificial, referring only to one of the great factors in
the production of species. And for this reason: Selection
only comes into existence in the modifications produced
either by external or internal changes; and the
selected change cannot be developed further by mere
inheritance, unless the successive progeny have such a
disposition of the organic affinities as will repeat the primary
change. Inherited superiority will not by mere
transmission become greater. The facts which are relied
on in support of the idea of “fixity of species” show at
any rate that a given superiority will remain stationary
for thousands of years; and no one supposes that the
progeny of an organism will vary unless some external
or internal cause of variation accompanies the inheritance.
Mr. Darwin agrees with Mr. Spencer in admitting the difficulty
of distinguishing between the effects of some
definite action of external conditions, and the accumulation
through natural selection of inherited variations
serviceable to the organism. But even in cases where
the distinction could be clearly established, I think we
should only see an <i>historical</i> distinction, that is to say,
one between effects produced by particular causes now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
in operation, and effects produced by very complex and
obscure causes in operation during ancestral development.</p>

<p>118<i>e</i>. The reader will understand that my criticism
does not pretend to invalidate Mr. Darwin’s discovery,
but rather to enlarge its terms, so as to make it include
all the biological conditions, and thus explain many of
the variations which Natural Selection—in the restricted
acceptation—leaves out of account. Mr. Darwin draws
a broad line of distinction between Variation and Selection,
regarding only those variations that are favorable as
selected. I conceive that all variations which survive are
by that fact of survival, <i>selections</i>, whether favorable or
indifferent. A variety is a species in formation; now
Selection itself is not a cause, or condition, of variation,
it is the <i>expression</i> of variation. Mr. Darwin is at times
explicit enough on this head: “It may metaphorically be
said that Natural Selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing
throughout the world the slightest variations; rejecting
those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are
good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and
wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each
organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions
of life.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> But the metaphorical nature of the
term is not always borne in mind, so that elsewhere
Natural Selection is said to “act on and modify organic
beings,” as if it were a positive condition and not the
expression of the modifying processes. Because grouse
are largely destroyed by birds of prey, any change in their
color which would render them less conspicuous would
enable more birds to escape; but it is obvious that this
change of color will be due to Organic Affinity; and only
when the change is <i>effected</i> will there have been that
selection which <i>expresses</i> it. Mr. Darwin’s language, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
is misleading. He says: “Hence Natural Selection
might be most effective in <i>giving</i> the proper color to each
kind of grouse, and in <i>keeping</i> that color when once
acquired.” This is to make Selection an agent, a condition
of the development of color; which may be accepted
if we extend the term so as to include the organic changes
themselves. Again: “Some writers have imagined that
Natural Selection <i>induces variability</i>, whereas it only implies
the <i>preservation</i> of such variations as are beneficial
to the being under its conditions of life.” It, however, is
made to imply more than this, namely, the accumulation
and further modification of such variations. “The mere
existence of individual variability and of some well-marked
varieties, though necessary as the foundation,
helps us but little in understanding how species arise in
nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one
part of the organization to another part, and to the conditions
of life, and of one organic being to another being,
been perfected?” My answer to this question would be:
By Organic Affinity, and the resulting struggle of the tissues
and organs, the consequences of which are that very
<i>adaptation</i> of the organism to external conditions, which
is expressed as the <i>selection</i> of the structures best adapted.
The selections are the results of the struggle, according
to my proposed extension of the term “struggle.” Mr.
Darwin defines the struggle: “The dependence of one
being on another, and including (what is more important)
not only the life of the individual but success in leaving
progeny.” This definition seems defective, since it omits
the primary and more important struggle which takes
place between the organic affinities in operation. To succeed
in the struggle with competitors, the organism must
have first acquired—by selection—a superiority in one
or more of its organs.</p>

<p>118<i>f</i>. A little reflection will disclose the importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
of keeping our eyes fixed on the internal causes of variation,
as well as on the external conditions of the struggle.
Mr. Darwin seems to imply that the external conditions
which cause a variation are to be distinguished from the
conditions which accumulate and perfect such variation,
that is to say, he implies a radical difference between the
process of variation and the process of selection. This, I
have already said, does not seem to me acceptable; the
selection, I conceive, to be simply the variation which
has survived.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>If it be true that a Variety is an incipient Species and
shows us Species in formation, it is in the same sense
true that a variation is an incipient organ. A species is
the result of a slowly accumulating divergence of structure;
an organ is the result of a slowly accumulating
differentiation. At each stage of differentiation there has
been a selection, but we cannot by any means say that
this selection was determined by the fact of its giving the
organism a superiority over rivals, inasmuch as during all
the early stages, while the organ was still in formation,
there could be no advantage accruing from it. One animal
having teeth and claws developed will have a decided
superiority in the struggle over another animal that has
no teeth and claws; but so long as the teeth and claws
are in an undeveloped state of mere preparation they
confer no superiority.</p>

<p>118<i>g</i>. Natural Selection is only the expression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
results of obscure physiological processes; and for a satisfactory
theory of such results we must understand the
nature of the processes. In other words, to understand
Natural Selection we must recognize not only the facts
thus expressed, but the factors of these facts,—we must
analyze the “conditions of existence.” As a preliminary
analysis we find <i>external conditions</i>, among which are included
not only the dependence of the organism on the
inorganic medium, but also the dependence of one organism
on another,—the competition and antagonism of the
whole organic world; and <i>internal conditions</i>, among which
are included not only the dependence of the organism on
the laws of composition and decomposition whereby each
organite and each tissue is formed, but also the dependence
of one organite and one tissue on all the others—the
competition and antagonism of all the elements.</p>

<p>The changes wrought in an organism by these two
kinds of conditions determine Varieties and Species. Although
many of the changes are due to the process of
natural selection brought about in the struggle with competitors
and foes, many other changes have no such relation
to the external struggle, but are simply the results
of the organic affinities. They may or they may not give
the organism a greater stability, or a greater advantage
over rivals; it is enough that they are no disadvantage
to the organism, they will then survive by virtue of the
forces which produced them.</p>

<p>119. The position thus reached will be important in
our examination of the Theory of Descent by which Mr.
Darwin tentatively, and his followers boldly, explain the
observed resemblances in structure and function as due to
blood-relationship. The doctrine of Evolution affirms that
all complex organisms are evolved by differentiation from
simpler organisms, as we see the complex organ evolved
from simpler forms. But it does not necessarily affirm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
that the vast variety of organisms had one starting-point—one
ancestor; on the contrary, I conceive that the
principles of Evolution are adverse to such a view, and
insist rather on the necessity of innumerable starting-points.
Let us consider the question.</p>

<p>That the Theory of Descent explains many of the facts
must be admitted; but there are many which it leaves
obscure; and Mr. Darwin, with that noble calmness
which distinguishes him, admits the numerous difficulties.
Whether these will hereafter be cleared away by an improvement
in the Geological Record, now confessedly
imperfect, or by more exhaustive exploration of distant
countries, none can say; but, to my mind, the probability
is, that we shall have to seek our explanation by enlarging
the idea of Natural Selection, subordinating it to the
laws of Organic Affinity. It does not seem to me, at present,
warrantable to assume Descent as the sole principle
of morphological uniformities; there are other grounds
of resemblance beyond those of blood-relationship; and
these have been too much overlooked; yet a brief consideration
will disclose that similarity in the physiological
laws and the conditions of Organic Affinity must
produce similarity in organisms, independently of relationship;
just as similarity in the laws and conditions
of inorganic affinity will produce identity in chemical
species. We do not suppose the carbonates and phosphates
found in various parts of the globe, or the families
of alkaloids and salts, to have any nearer kinship than
that which consists in the similarity of their elements
and the conditions of their combination. Hence, in organisms,
as in salts, morphological identity may be due
to a community of conditions, rather than community of
descent. Mr. Darwin justly holds it to be “incredible
that individuals identically the same should have been
produced through Natural Selection from parents <i>specifically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
distinct</i>,” but he, since he admits analogous variations,
will not deny that identical forms might issue from
parents having widely different origins, provided that
these parent forms and the conditions of their reproduction
were identical, as in the case of vegetable and animal
resemblances. To deny this would be to deny the law of
causation. And that which is true of identical forms
under identical conditions is true of similar forms under
similar conditions. When History and Ethnology
reveal a striking uniformity in the progression of social
phases, we do not thence conclude that the nations are
directly related, or that the social forms have a common
parentage; we conclude that the social phases are alike
because they have had common causes. When chemists
point out the uniformity of type which exists in compounds
so diverse in many of their properties as water
and sulphuretted or selenetted hydrogen, and when they
declare phosphoretted hydrogen to be the congener of
ammonia, they do not mean that the one is descended
from the other, or that any closer link connects them
than that of resemblance in their elements.</p>

<p>In the case of vegetal and animal organisms, we observe
such a community of elementary substance as of
itself to imply a community in their laws of combination;
and under similar conditions the evolved forms
must be similar. With this community of elementary
substance, there are also diversities of substance and of
co-operant conditions; corresponding with these diversities
there must be differences of form. Thus, although
observation reveals that the bond of kinship does really
unite many widely divergent forms, and the principle of
Descent with Natural Selection will account for many of
the resemblances and differences, there is at present no
warrant for assuming that all resemblances and differences
are due to this one cause, but, on the contrary, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
are justified in assuming a deeper principle which may be
thus formulated: All the complex organisms are evolved
from organisms less complex, as these were evolved from
simpler forms; the link which unites all organisms is not
always the common bond of heritage, but the uniformity
of organized substance acting under similar conditions.</p>

<p>It is therefore consistent with the hypothesis of Evolution
to admit a variety of origins or starting-points,
though not consistent to admit the sudden appearance
of complex Types, such as is implied in the hypothesis
of specific creations.</p>

<p>119 <i>a</i>. The analogies of organic forms and functions
demand a more exhaustive scrutiny than has yet been
given them. Why is it that vessels, nerves, and bones
<i>ramify</i> like branches, and why do these branches take on
the aspect of many crystalline forms? Why is it that
cavities are constantly prolonged in ducts, e. g. the mouth
succeeded by the œsophagus, the stomach by the intestines,
the bladder by the urethra, the heart by the aorta,
the ovary by the oviduct, and so on? Why are there
never more than four limbs attached to a vertebral
column, and these always attached to particular vertebræ?
Why is there a tendency in certain tissues to
form tubes, and in these tubes commonly to assume a
muscular coat?<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> To some of these queries an answer
might be suggested which would bring them under known
physical laws. I merely notice them here for the sake
of emphasizing the fact that such analogies lie deeply
imbedded in the laws of evolution, and that what has
been metaphorically called organic crystallization will
account for many similarities in form, without forcing us
to have recourse to kinship. To take a very simple case.
No one will maintain that the crystalline forms of snow
have any kinship with the plants which they often resemble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Mr. Spencer has noticed the development of a
wing-bearing branch from a wing of the <i>Ptilota plumosa</i>,
when its nutrition is in excess. “This form, so strikingly
like that of the feathery crystallizations of many
inorganic substances, proves to us that in such crystallizations
the simplicity or complexity of structure at any
place depends on the quantity of matter that has to be
polarized at that place in a given time. How the element
of time modifies the result, is shown by the familiar
fact that crystals rapidly formed are small, and that
they become larger when they are formed more slowly.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>It may be objected, and justly, that in the resemblance
between crystals and organisms the analogy is purely
that of form, and usually confined to one element, whereas
between organisms there is resemblance of substance
no less than of form, and usually the organisms are alike
in several respects. The answer to this objection is,
that wherever there is a similarity in the causal conditions
(substance and history) there must be a corresponding
similarity in the results; if this similarity extends
to only a few of the conditions, the analogy will be
slight; if to several, deep. But whether slight or deep
we are not justified, simply on the ground of resemblance,
in assuming, short of evidence, that because they are
alike, two organisms are related by descent from a common
ancestor.</p>

<p>120. Let us glance at a few illustrations. It has been
urged as a serious objection to Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
that it fails to explain the existence of phosphorescent
organs in a few insects; and certainly, when one considers
the widely different orders in which these organs
appear, and their absence in nearly related forms, it is
a difficulty. In noctilucæ, earthworms, molluscs, scolopendra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
and fireflies, we may easily suppose the presence
of similar organic conditions producing the luminosity;
but it requires a strong faith to assign Descent as the
cause.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> We may say the same of the electric organs
possessed by seven species of fish, belonging to five
widely separated genera. Although each species appears
to have a limited geographical range, one or the other is
found in almost every part of the globe. These organs
occupy different positions, being now on each side of the
head, now along the body, and now along the tail; and
in different species they are innervated from different
sources. Their intimate structure also varies; as appears
from the remarkable investigations of Max Schultze.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
They cannot, therefore, be homologous. How could they
have arisen? Not by the slow accumulations of Natural
Selection, because, until the organs were fully formed,
they could be of no advantage in the struggle; hence the
slow growth of the organ must have proceeded without
the aid of an advantage in the struggle—in each case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
from some analogous conditions which produced a differentiation
in certain muscles. The fundamental resemblance
to muscles was pointed out by Carus long ago.
It has been insisted on by Leydig:<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and Owen says,
“The row of compressed cells constituting the electric
prism of the Torpedo offers some analogy to the row of
microscopic discs of which the elementary muscle fibre
appears to consist.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> We must not, however, forget
that these resemblances are merely such as suggest that
the electric organ is a <i>differentiation</i> of the substance
which elsewhere becomes muscular, and that Dr. Davy
was justified in denying the organ to be muscular.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
That it is substituted for muscle cannot be doubted.
Now, although we are entirely ignorant of the conditions
which cause this differentiation of substance which elsewhere
becomes muscular, but here becomes electric organs,
we can understand that, when once such a development
had taken place, if it in any way profited the fish in its
struggle for existence, Natural Selection would <i>tend</i> to
its further increase and propagation. So far Mr. Darwin
carries us with him; but we decline proceeding further.
The development of these organs in fishes so widely removed,
does not imply an ancestral community. It is
interpretable as mere growth on a basis once laid; and
therefore would occur with or without any advantage in
the struggle with rivals. The similarity in concurrent
conditions is quite enough to account for the resemblance
in structure. This, with his accustomed candor, Mr.
Darwin admits. “If the electric organs,” he says, “had
been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided,
we might have expected that all electric fishes would be
specially related to each other. Nor does Geology at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric
organs which most of their modified descendants have
lost.”</p>

<p id="I_121">121. It may seem strange that he should urge a difficulty
against his hypothesis when it could be avoided
by the simple admission that even among nearly allied
animals great differences in development are observable,
and the electric organs might be ranged under such
diversities. But Mr. Darwin has so thoroughly wrought
out his scheme, that he foresees most objections, and
rightly suspects that if this principle of divergent development
be admitted, it will cut the ground from under a
vast array of facts which his hypothesis of Descent
requires.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of new organs, not a trace of
which is discernible in the embryo or adult form of organisms
lower in the scale,—for instance, the phosphorescent
and electric organs,—is like the sudden appearance of
new instruments in the social organism, such as the printing-press
and the railway, wholly inexplicable on the
theory of Descent,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> but is explicable on the theory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Organic Affinity. For observe: if we admit that differentiations
of structure, and the sudden appearance of
organs, can have arisen spontaneously—i. e. not hereditarily—as
the outcome of certain changed physical conditions,
we can hardly refuse to extend to the whole
organism what we admit of a particular organ. If, again,
we admit that organs very similar in structure and function
spontaneously appear in organisms of widely different
kinds—e. g. the phosphorescent and electric organs—we
must also admit that similar resemblances may present
themselves in organisms having a widely different
parentage; and thus the admission of the spontaneous
evolution of closely resembling organs carries with it the
admission of the spontaneous evolution of closely resembling
organisms: that the protoplasm of muscular tissue
should, under certain changed conditions, develop into the
tissue of electric organs, is but one case of the law that
organized substance will develop into organisms closely
resembling each other when the conditions have been
similar.</p>

<p>122. It is to be remarked that Mr. Darwin fixes his
attention somewhat too exclusively on the adaptations
which arise during the external struggle for existence, and
to that extent neglects the laws of organic affinity; just
as Lamarck too exclusively fixed his attention on the
influence of external conditions and of wants. Not that
Mr. Darwin can be said to overlook the organic laws; he
simply underestimates the part they play. Occasionally
he seems arrested by them, as when instancing the “trailing
palm in the Malay Archipelago, which climbs the
loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance
no doubt is of the highest service to the plant; but
as there are nearly similar hooks on many trees which are
not climbers, the hooks on the palm may have arisen from
unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently
taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification
and becoming a climber.”</p>

<p>123. I come round to the position from which I started,
that the resemblances traceable among animals are no
proof of kinship; even a resemblance so close as to defy
discrimination would not, in itself, be such a proof. The
absolute identity of chalk in Australia and in Europe is
a proof that there was absolute identity in the formative
conditions and the constituent elements, but no proof
whatever that the two substances were originally connected
by genesis. In like manner the similarity of a
plant or animal in Africa and Europe may be due to a
common kinship, but it may also be due to a <i>common history</i>.
It is indeed barely conceivable that the history,
from first to last, would ever be so rigorously identical in
two parts of the globe as to produce complex identical
forms in both; because <i>any</i> diversity, either in structure
or external conditions, may be the starting-point of a wide
diversity in subsequent development; and the case of
organic combinations is so far unlike the inorganic, that
while only one form is possible to the latter (chalk is
either formed or not formed), many forms are possible
to organic elements owing to the complexity and indefiniteness
of organic composition. But although forms so
allied as those of Species are not readily assignable to an
identical history in different quarters of the globe, it is
not only conceivable, but is eminently probable, that Orders
and Classes have no nearer link of relationship than
is implied in their community of organized substance and
their common history. The fact that there is not a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
mammal common to Europe and Australia is explicable,
as Mr. Darwin explains it, on the ground that migration
has been impossible to them; but it is also explicable on
the laws of Evolution—to have had mammals of the
same species and genera would imply a minute coincidence
in their history, which is against the probabilities.
Again, in the Oceanic Islands there are no Batrachians;
but there are Reptiles, and these conform to the reptilian
type. Mr. Darwin suggests that the absence of Batrachia
is due to the impossibility of migration, their ova being
destroyed by salt water. But may it not be due to the
divergence from the reptilian type, which was effected
elsewhere, not having taken place in these regions?
When we find the metal Tin in Prussia and Cornwall,
and nowhere else in Europe, must we not conclude that
in these two countries, and nowhere else, a peculiar conjunction
of conditions caused this peculiar evolution?</p>

<p>124. The question at issue is, Are the resemblances
observable among organic forms due to remote kinship,
and their diversities to the divergences caused by adaptation
to new conditions? or are the resemblances due
to similarities, and the diversities to dissimilarities in
the <i>substance and history</i> of organic beings? Are we to
assume one starting-point and one centre of creation, or
many similar starting-points at many centres? So far
from believing that all plants and animals had their origin
in one primordial cell, at one particular spot, from which
descendants migrated and became diversified under the
diverse conditions of their migration, it seems to me more
consistent with the principle of Evolution to admit a vast
variety of origins more or less resembling each other;
and this initial resemblance will account for the similarities
still traceable under the various forms; while the
<i>early differences</i>, becoming intensified by development under
different conditions, will yield the diversities. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
evolution of organisms, like the evolution of crystals, or
the evolution of islands and continents, is determined,
1st, by laws <i>inherent in the substances evolved</i>, and, 2d, by
relations to the medium in which the evolution takes
place. This being so, we may <i>à priori</i> affirm that the
resultant forms will have a community strictly corresponding
with the resemblance of the substances and their conditions
of evolution, together with a diversity corresponding
with their differences in substance and conditions. It
is usually supposed that the admission of separate “centres
of creation” is tantamount to an admission of “successive
creations” as interpreted by the majority of those
who invoke “creative fiats.” But the doctrine of Evolution,
which regards Life as making its appearance <i>consequent
upon a concurrence of definite conditions</i>, and regards
the specific forms of Life as the necessary consequences
of special circumstances, must also accept the probability
of similar conditions occurring at different times and in
different places. Upon what grounds, cosmical or biological,
are we to assume that on only <i>one</i> microscopic
spot of this developing planet such a group of conditions
was found—on only one spot a particle of protein substance
was formed out of the abundant elements, and
under conditions which caused it to grow and multiply,
till in time its descendants overran the globe? The hypothesis
that all organic forms are the descendants of a
single germ, or of even a few germs, and are therefore
united by links of kinship more or less remote, is not
more acceptable than the hypothesis that all the carbonates
and phosphates, all the crystals, and all the strata
found in different parts of the globe, are the <i>descendants
of a single molecule</i>, or a few molecules; or,—since this
may seem too extravagant,—than that the various maladies
which afflict organic beings are, in a literal sense,
members of <i>families</i> having a nearer relationship than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
that of being the phenomena manifested by similar organs
under similar conditions—a conception which might have
been accepted by those metaphysical pathologists who
regarded Disease as an entity. Few philosophers have
any hesitation in supposing that other planets besides our
own are peopled with organic forms, though, from the
great differences in the conditions, these forms must be
extremely unlike those of our own planet. If separate
worlds, why not separate centres? The conclusion seems
inevitable that wherever and whenever the state of things
permitted that peculiar combination of elements known
as organized substance, there and then a centre was established—Life
had a root. From roots closely resembling
each other in all essential characters, but all more or less
different, there have been developed the various stems of
the great tree. Myriads of roots have probably perished
without issue; myriads have developed into forms so ill-adapted
to sustain the fluctuations of the medium, so
ill-fitted for the struggle of existence, that they became
extinct before even our organic record begins; myriads
have become extinct since then; and the descendants of
those which now survive are like the shattered regiments
and companies after some terrific battle.</p>

<p>125. There seems to me only one alternative logically
permissible to the Evolution Hypothesis, namely, that all
organic forms have had either a single origin, or else
numerous origins; in other words, that a primordial cell
was the starting-point from which all organisms have
been successively developed; or that the development
issued from many independent starting-points, more or
less varied. This is apparently not the aspect presented
by the hypothesis to many of its advocates; they seem
to consider that if all organic forms are not the lineal
descendants of one progenitor, they must at any rate be
the descendants of not more than four or five. The common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
belief inclines to one. Mr. Darwin, whose caution
is as remarkable as his courage, and whose candor is
delightful, hesitates as to which conclusion should be
adopted: “I cannot doubt,” he says, “that the theory of
descent, with modifications, embraces all the members of
the same class. I believe that animals have descended
from, at most, only four or five progenitors, and plants
from an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead me
one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals
and plants have descended from some one prototype.
But analogy may be a deceitful guide.”</p>

<p>126. I cannot see the evidence which would warrant
the belief that Life originated solely in one microscopic
lump of protoplasm on one single point of our earth’s
surface; on the contrary, it is more probable that from
innumerable and separate points of this teeming earth,
myriads of protoplast sprang into existence, <i>whenever</i>
and <i>wherever</i> the conditions of the formation of organized
substance were present. It is probable that this has been
incessantly going on, and that every day new protoplasts
appear, struggle for existence, and serve as food for more
highly organized rivals; but whether an evolution of the
lower forms is, or is not, still going on, there can be no
reluctance on the part of every believer in Evolution to
admit that when organized substance was first evolved, it
was evolved at many points. If this be so, the community
observable in organized substance, wherever found,
may as often be due to the fact of a common elementary
composition as to the fact of inheritance. If this be so,
we have a simple explanation both of the fundamental
resemblances which link all organisms together, and of the
characteristic diversities which separate them into kingdoms,
classes, and orders. The resemblances are many,
and close, because the forms evolved had a similar elementary
composition, and their stages of evolution were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
determined by similar conditions. The diversities are
many, because the forms evolved had from the first some
diversities in elementary composition, and their stages
of evolution were determined under conditions which,
though similar in general, have varied in particulars.
Indeed, there is no other ground for the resemblances
and differences among organic beings than the similarities
and dissimilarities in their Substance and History;
and, whether the similarities are due to blood-relationship,
or to other causes, the results are the same. There
is something seductive in the supposition that Life radiated
from a single centre in ever-increasing circles, its
forms becoming more and more various as they came
under more various conditions, until at last the whole
earth was crowded with diversified existences. “From
one cell to myriads of complex organisms, through countless
æons of development,” is a formula of speculative
grandeur, but I cannot bring myself to accept it; and I
think that a lingering influence of the tradition of a “creative
fiat” may be traced in its conception. May we not
rather assume that the earth at the dawn of Life was a
vast germinal membrane, every slightly diversified point
producing its own vital form; and these myriads upon
myriads of forms—all alike and all unlike—urged by
the indwelling tendencies of development, struggled with
each other for existence, many failing, many victorious,
the victors carrying their tents into the camping ground
of the vanquished. The point raised is the immense improbability
of organized substance having been evolved
only in one microscopic spot; if it were evolved at more
than one spot, and under slightly varying conditions,
there would necessarily have arisen in these earliest formations
the <i>initial</i> diversities which afterwards determined
the essential independence and difference of organisms.</p>

<p>129. Let us for a moment glance at the resemblances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
diversities observable in all organisms. All have a <i>common
basis</i>, all being constructed out of the same fundamental
elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen;
these (the organogens, as they are named), with varying
additions of some other elements, make up what we
know as Organic Substance, vegetal and animal. Another
peculiarity all organisms have in common, namely, that
their matter is neither solid nor liquid, but viscid. Beside
this community of <i>Substance</i> we must now place a
community of <i>History</i>. All organisms grow and multiply
by the same process; all pass through metamorphic
stages ending in death; all, except the very simplest,
differentiate parts of their substance for special uses, and
these parts (cilia, membranes, tubes, glands, muscles,
nerves) have similar characters in whatever organism
they appear, and their development is always similar, so
that the muscles or nerves of an intestinal worm, a lobster,
or a man, are in structure and history fundamentally
alike. When, therefore, we see that there is no biological
character of fundamental importance which is not universal
throughout the organic world, when we see that in
Structure and History all organisms have a community
pervading every variety, it is difficult not to draw the
conclusion that some hidden link connects all organisms
into one; and when, further, it is seen that the most
divergent forms may be so arranged by the help of intermediate
forms only slightly varying one from the other,
that the extreme ends—the monad and the man—may
be connected, and a genealogical tree constructed, which
will group all forms as modified descendants from a
single form, the hypothesis that kinship is the bidden
link of which we are in search becomes more and more
cogent.</p>

<p id="I_130">130. But now let the other aspect be considered. If
there is an unmistakable uniformity, there is also a diversity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
no less unmistakable. The chemical composition of
organic substances is various. Unlike inorganic substances,
the composition of which is rigorously definite,
organic substances are, within narrow limits, variable in
composition (§ <a href="#I_45">45</a>).</p>

<p>I pass over the resemblances and differences observed
in the earliest stages of development, marked as they are,
and direct attention to the fact, that down at what must
be considered the very lowest organic region, we meet
with differences not less striking than those met with in
the highest, we find structures (if structures they may be
called), which cannot be affiliated, so widely divergent is
their composition. The structureless vibrio, for example,
is not only capable of living in a medium destitute of
Oxygen, but is, according to M. Pasteur, actually killed by
oxygen; whereas the equally simple bacteria can no more
dispense with Oxygen than other animals can. Consider
for a moment the differences implied in the fact that one
organism cannot even form an enveloping membrane to
contain its protoplasm, whereas another contrives to secrete
an exquisite shell; yet between the naked Rhizopod
and the shelled Rhizopod our lenses and reagents fail to
detect a difference. One Monad can assimilate food of
only one kind, another Monad assimilates various kinds.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
What a revelation of chemical differences appears in the
observations of M. Pasteur respecting the vibrio and bacteria,
in a fermentescible liquid—the former beginning
the putrid fermentation which the latter completes! We
cannot doubt that some marked difference must exist between
the single-celled organism which produces alcoholic
fermentation, and that which produces acetic fermentation,
and that again which produces butyric fermentation;
and if we find distinctions thus established at the lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
region of the organic series, we need not marvel if the
distinctions become wider and more numerous as the
series becomes more diversified. The structure and development
of an organism are dependent on the affinities of
its constituent molecules, and it is a biological principle
of great importance which Sir James Paget insists on,
when he shows how “the existence of certain materials
in the blood may determine the formation of structures in
which they may be incorporated.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> <i>Any</i> initial diversity
may thus become the starting-point of a considerable
variation in subsequent evolution.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Thus, supposing
that on a given spot there are a dozen protoplasts closely
resembling each other, yet each in some one detail slightly
varying; if this variation is one which, by its relations to
the external medium, admits of a difference in the assimilation
of materials present in the medium, it may be the
origin of some <i>new direction</i> in development, and the ultimate
consequence may be the formation of a shell, an
internal skeleton, a muscle, or a nerve. Were this not so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
it would be impossible to explain such facts as that chitine
is peculiar to the Articulata, cellulose to Molluscoida,
carbonates of lime to Mollusca and Crustacea, and phosphates
to Vertebrata—all assimilated from the same
external medium. But we see that from this medium
one organism selects the materials which another rejects;
and this selection is determined by the nature of the
structure: which assimilates only those materials it is
<i>fitted</i> to assimilate. We hear a great deal of Adaptation
determining changes of structure and function, and are
too apt to regard this process as if it were not intimately
dependent on a corresponding structural change. By no
amount of external influence which left the elementary
composition of the structure unchanged, could an organism
with only two tissues be developed into an organism
with three or four. By no supply or stimulus, could an
animal incapable of assimilating peroxide of iron acquire
red blood corpuscles, although it might have the iron
without the corpuscles; nor could an oyster form its shell
unless capable of assimilating carbonate of lime. For
myriads of years, in seas and ponds, under endless varieties
of external conditions, the amœbæ have lived and
died without forming a solid envelope, although the materials
were abundant, and other organisms equally simple
have formed envelopes of infinite variety. In all the
seas, and from the earliest ages, zoophytes have lived, and
assumed a marvellous variety of shapes and specialization
of functions; but although some of them have acquired
muscles, none have acquired true nerves, none bone.
Ages upon ages rolled on before fishes were capable of
forming bone; and thousands are still incapable of forming
it, though living in the same waters as the osseous
fishes.</p>

<p>131. “Looking to the dawn of life,” says Mr. Darwin
(repeating an objection urged against his hypothesis),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“when all organic beings, as we imagine, presented the
simplest structure, how could the first steps in advancement,
or in the differentiation and specialization of parts
have arisen? I can make no sufficient answer; and can
only say that, as we have no facts to guide us, all speculation
would be baseless and useless.”</p>

<p>Where Mr. Darwin hesitates, lesser men need extra
caution; but I must risk the danger of presumption, at
least so far as to suggest that while an answer to this
question is difficult on that dynamical view of Evolution
which regards Function as determining Structure, it is
less difficult on the statico-dynamical view propounded in
these pages; the difficulty which besets the explanation
when all the manifold varieties of organic forms are conceived
as the successive divergences from an original
starting-point, is lessened when a variety of different
starting-points is assumed, in each of which some initial
diversity prepared the way for subsequent differentiations;
just as we know that between the ovum of a vertebrate
and the ovum of an invertebrate, similar as they
are, there is a diversity which manifests itself in their
subsequent evolution. If Function is determined by
Structure, and Evolution is the product of the two, it is
clear that the different directions in the lines of development
will have their origin in structural differences, and
not in the action of external circumstances, unless these
previously bring about a structural change. The action
of the medium on the organism is assuredly a potent factor
which Biology cannot ignore: but the organism itself
is a factor, and according to its nature the influence of
the medium is defined. (§ <a href="#I_118">118</a>.)</p>

<p>132. Quitting for a moment the track of this argument,
let us glance at the resemblances and differences
observable in Plants and Animals, because most people
admit that these have separate origins. The resemblances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
are scarcely less significant than those existing among
animals. Both have a similar basis of elementary composition;
not only are both formed out of protoplasts
with similar properties, but in both the first step from the
protoplasm to definite structure is the Cell. And the life
of this Cell is remarkably alike in both, its phases of development
being in many respects identical; nay, even
such variations as obtain in the cell-membranes are curiously
linked together by a community in the formative
process.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> In both Plants and Animals we find individuals
constituted—1st, by single cells; 2d, by groups
of cells undistinguishable among each other; and 3d, by
groups of differentiated cells. In both we find colonies of
individuals leading a common life. In both the processes
of Nutrition and Reproduction are essentially similar;
both propagate sexually and asexually; both exhibit the
surprising phenomena of parthenogenesis and alternate
generations. In both there are examples of a free-roving
embryo which in maturity becomes fixed to one spot, losing
its locomotive organs and developing its reproductive
organs. In both the development of the reproductive
organs is the climax which carries Death. So close is the
analogy between plant-life and animal-life, that it even
reaches the properties usually held to be exclusively animal;
I mean that even should we hesitate to accept Cohn’s
discovery of the muscles in certain plants,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> we cannot deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
that plants exhibit Contractility; and should we refuse to
interpret as Sensibility the phenomena exhibited by the
Sensitive Plants, we cannot deny that they present a very
striking analogy to the phenomena of Sensibility exhibited
by animals.</p>

<p>133. It is unnecessary to continue this enumeration,
which might easily be carried into minute detail. A
chapter of such resemblances would only burden the
reader’s mind, without adding force to the conclusion
that a surprising community in Substance and Life-history
must be admitted between Plants and Animals.
This granted, we turn to the differences, and find them
no less fundamental and detailed. Chemistry tells us
nothing of the differences in the protoplasms from which
animals and plants arise; but that initial differences
must exist is proved by the divergence of the products.
The vegetable cell is not the animal cell; and although
both plants and animals have albumen, fibrine, and caseine,
the <i>derivatives</i> of these are unlike. Horny substance,
connective tissue, nerve tissue, chitine, biliverdine, creatine,
urea, hippuric acid, and a variety of other products
of evolution or of waste, never appear in plants; while
the hydrocarbons so abundant in plants are, with two or
three exceptions, absent from animals. Such facts imply
differences in elementary composition; and this result is
further enforced by the fact that where the two seem to
resemble, they are still different: the plant protoplasm
forms various cells, but never forms a cartilage-cell or
nerve-cell; fibres, but never a fibre of elastic tissue;
tubes, but never a nerve tube; vessels, but never a vessel
with muscular coatings; solid “skeletons,” but always
from an organic substance (<i>cellulose</i>), not from phosphates
and carbonates. In no one character can we say that
the plant and the animal are identical; we can only
point throughout the two kingdoms to a great similarity
accompanying a radical diversity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
134. Having brought together the manifold resemblances,
and the no less marked diversities, we must ask
what is their significance? Do the resemblances imply
a community of origin, an universal kinship? If so, the
diversities will be nothing more than the divergences
which have been produced by variations in the Life-history
of the several groups. Or—taking the alternative
view—do the diversities imply radical differences
of origin? If so, the resemblances will be nothing more
than the inevitable analogies resulting from Organized
Substance being everywhere somewhat similar in composition,
and similar in certain phases of evolution. To
state the former position in the simplest way, we may
assume that of two masses of protoplasm having a common
parentage, one, by the accident of assimilating a
certain element not brought within the range of the
other, thereby becomes so differentiated as to form the
starting-point of a series of evolutions widely divergent
from those possible to its congener; and at each stage of
evolution the introduction of a new element (made possible
by that stage) will form the origin of a new variation.
It is thus feasible to reduce all organic forms to a primordial
protoplasm, in the evolutions of which successive
differentiations have been established. On the other hand,
it is equally feasible to assume that the existence of
radical differences must be invoked to account for the
possibility of the successive differentiations.</p>

<p>135. The hunt after resemblances has led to much
mistaken speculation; and with reference to the topic
now before us, it may be urged, that although by attaching
ourselves to the points of community, in disregard of
the diversities, we may make it appear that all animals
have a common parentage, and that plants and animals
are merely divergent groups of the same prototype, a
rigorous logic will force us onwards, and compel us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
admit that a kinship no less real unites the organic with
the inorganic world. For upon what principle are we to
pause at the cell or protoplasm? If by a successive
elimination of differences we reduce all organisms to the
cell, we must go on and reduce the cell itself to the
chemical elements out of which it is constructed; and inasmuch
as these elements are all common to the inorganic
world, the only difference being one of synthesis, we
reach a result which is the stultification of all classification,
namely, the assertion of a kinship which is universal.
We must bear in mind that all things may be reduced
to a common root by simply disregarding their differences.
All things are alike when we set aside their unlikeness.</p>

<p>136. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, we regard
an Orchestra in the light of the Development Hypothesis.
The various instruments of which it is composed have
general resemblances and particular differences, not unlike
those observable in various organisms; and as we proceed
in the work of classification we quickly discover that
they may be arranged in groups analogous to the Sub-kingdoms,
Classes, Orders, Genera, and Species of the
organic world. Each group has its cardinal distinction,
its initial point of divergence. All musical instruments
resemble each other in the fundamental character of producing
Tone by the vibrations of their substance. This
may be called their organic basis. The first marked
difference which determines the character of two sub-kingdoms
(namely, instruments of Percussion and Wind
instruments) arises from a difference in the method of impressing
the vibrations; and the grand divisions of these
sub-kingdoms arise from the nature of the vibrating substances.
Each type admits of many modifications, but
the primary distinction is ineffaceable. We can conceive
the Pipe modified into a Flute, a Flageolet, a Clarionet,
a Hautbois, a Bassoon, or a Fife, by simple accessory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
changes; to modify the Pipe into a Trumpet, and thus
produce the peculiar <i>timbre</i> of the trumpet, would be
impossible except by the <i>substitution</i> of a new material;
by replacing the wood with metal we may adhere to the
old Type, but we have created a new Class. (Attention
is requested to this point, because the current views
respecting the transmutation of tissues, which seem to
lend a decisive support to the hypothesis of the transmutation
of species are very commonly vitiated by the
confusion of transformation with substitution. No anatomical
element is <i>transformed</i> into another specifically
different—an epithelial-cell into a nerve-cell, for instance—but
one anatomical element is frequently <i>substituted</i>
for another.) To convert the Pipe or the Trumpet into
a Violin or a Drum would be impossible. We can follow
the modifications of a Tambourine into a Drum or Kettle-drum,
but no modifications of these will yield the
Cymbals. That is to say, the vibrating materials—wood,
metal, parchment, and the combination of wood
and strings—have peculiar properties, and the instruments
formed of such materials must necessarily from
the very first belong to different groups, each subdivision
of the groups being dependent on some characteristic
difference in methods of impressing the vibrations, or in
the materials. Although all musical instruments have
a common property and a common purpose, we do not
regard them as transformations of one primitive instrument;
their kindred nature is a subjective conception;
the analogies are numerous and close, but we know their
origin. It is obvious that men being pleased by musical
tones, have been led by their delight to construct instruments
whenever they have discovered substances capable
of musical vibrations, or methods of impressing such
vibrations. By substituting the bow for the plectrum or
the fingers, they may have changed the Lyre into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Violin, Viola, Violoncello, and Bass. (It seems historically
probable that the real origin of the Violin class was
an instrument with one string played on by a bow.) By
grouping together Pipes of various sizes they got the Panpipes;
by substituting metal and enlarging the blowing
apparatus they got the Organ. By beating on stretched
parchment with the finger, they got the Tambourine and
Tom-Tom; by doubling this and using a stick they got
the Drum. By beating metal with metal they got the
Cymbals; by beating wood they got the Castanets.</p>

<p>137. The application of this illustration is plain. Just
as a wind-instrument is incapable of becoming a stringed
instrument, so a Mollusc, with all its muscles unstriped,
and its nervous system unsymmetrical, is incapable of
becoming a Crustacean, with all its muscles striped and
its nervous system symmetrical. Indeed there are probably
few biologists of the present day who imagine the
transmutation of one kind into the other to be possible;
but many biologists assume that both may have been
evolved from a common root. The point is beyond proof;
yet I think there is a greater probability in the assumption
that both were evolved from different roots. At any
rate, one thing is certain; a divergence could only have
been effected by a series of <i>substitutions</i>; and the question
when and how these substitutions took place is unanswerable:
one school believes them to have been creative
fiats, the other school believes them to have been transmutations.</p>

<p>138. When we see an annelid and a vertebrate resembling
each other in some special point which is not common
either to their classes or to any intermediate classes—as
when we see the wood-louse (<i>Oniscus</i>) and the hedgehog
defend themselves in the same strange way by rolling up
into a ball—we cannot interpret this as a trace of distant
kinship. When we see a breed of pigeons and a breed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of canaries turning somersaults, and one of the Bear family
(<i>Ratel</i>) given to the same singular habit, we can hardly
suppose that this is in each case inherited from a common
progenitor. When we see one savage race tipping arrows
with iron, and another, ignorant of iron, using poison,
there is a community of object effected by diversity of
means; but the analogy does not necessarily imply any
closer connection between the two races than the fact that
men with similar faculties and similar wants find out similar
methods of supplying their wants. Even those who
admit that the human race is one family, and that the
various peoples carried with them a common fund of
knowledge when they separated from the parent stock,
may still point to a variety of new inventions and new
social developments which occurred quite independently
of each other, yet are strikingly alike. Their resemblance
will be due to resemblance in the conditions. The existence,
for example, of a religious worship, or a social institution,
in two nations widely separated both in time and
space, and under great historical diversities, is no absolute
proof that these two nations are from the same stock, and
that the ideas have the same parentage. It may be so;
it may be otherwise. It may be an analogy no more implying
kinship than the fact of ants making slaves of
other ants (and these the black ants!) implies a kinship
with men. Given an organization which in the two nations
is alike, and a history which is in certain characteristics
analogous, there must inevitably result religious and
social institutions having a corresponding resemblance.
I do not wish to imply that the researches of philologists
and ethnologists are misdirected, or that their conclusions
respecting the kinship of mankind are to be rejected; I
only urge the consideration that perhaps too much stress
is laid on community of blood, and not enough on community
of conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_10">RECAPITULATION.</h3>

<p>139. The various lines of argument may here be recapitulated.
The organic world presents a spectacle of endless
diversity, accompanied by a pervading uniformity.
The general resemblances in forms and functions are more
or less masked by particular differences. The resemblances,
it is said, may be all due to kinship, all the living
individuals having descended from a primordial cell; and
at each stage of the descent the adaptations to new conditions
may have issued in deviations from the ancestral
form, while the process of Natural Selection giving stability
to those variations which best fitted the organism
in the struggle of existence, has made greater and greater
gaps, and produced more marked diversities among the
descendants. This is the Darwinian Theory: “On my
theory unity of Type is explained by unity of Descent.”</p>

<p>140. By the general consent of biologists, this theory
is held to explain many if not all the observed facts. It
is a very luminous suggestion; but it requires an enlargement
so as to include Organic Affinity; and when once
this fundamental principle is admitted, it brings with it
very serious doubts as to the theory of Descent. We are
then entitled to assume that many of the most striking
resemblances, instead of being due to kinship, are due
simply to the general principle that similar causes must
have similar effects, and that organic substances having a
very close resemblance, organized substances must have
similar stages of evolution under similar conditions; and
thus organs will necessarily take on very similar forms in
very different organisms (for example, the eye of the
cephalopod and the eye of the vertebrate), and organisms
having widely different parentage may closely resemble
each other. If we are entitled to assume that protoplasm
appeared not in one microscopic spot alone, but in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
places and in vast quantities—and this is surely the
more justifiable assumption—then we must also admit
that these germinal starting-points were from the first, or
very shortly afterwards, differentiated by variations in
their elementary composition. Now we know that a very
minute change in composition may lead to immense differences
in evolution. Thus the descendants of two
slightly different progenitors may, by continual differentiation,
become very markedly unlike; yet, because of the
original resemblance of their substances, they will reveal
a pervading similarity.</p>

<p>While it is thus conceivable that all organisms may
resemble each other, and all differ, owing to the similarities
and diversities in the “conditions of existence” (and
among those conditions that of descent is of wide range),
it is not very readily conceivable how advantage in the
external struggle could have determined the varieties of
form and function, because many differentiations give no
superiority in the struggle. As Mr. St. George Mivart
urges, “Natural Selection utterly fails to account for the
conservation and development of the minute and rudimentary
beginnings, the slight and infinitesimal commencements
of structures, however useful those structures
may afterwards become.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> And this is undeniable on the
supposition that Natural Selection is an agency not identical
with the variations of growth, but exclusively confined
to the accumulation of favorable variations.</p>

<p>141. In estimating the two hypotheses—First, of
Descent from one primordial germ, and the modifications
<i>due</i> to Natural Selection, or, as I should say, <i>expressed</i> in
Selection; and Secondly, of Descent from innumerable
germs having initial differences, which differences radiated
into the marked modifications, there is this superiority to
be claimed for the first, that it is more easily handled as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
an aid to research, and is therefore more decidedly useful.
The laws of Organic Affinity are at present too obscure
for any successful application. I only wish to point out
that the theory of Descent is an imaginary construction
of what <i>may have been</i> the process of species-formation,
not a transcription of the process observed. It constructs
an imaginary Type as progenitor of a long line of widely
different descendants. The annelid which is taken as the
ancestor of the vertebrates is not any annelid known
either to zoölogists or geologists, but a generalized and
imaginary type. So daringly liberal is the imagination
in endowing the ancestor with whatever may be required
for the descendants, that Mr. Darwin thinks it <i>probable</i>,
from what we know of the embryos of vertebrates, that
these animals “are the modified descendants of some ancient
progenitor which was furnished in its adult state
with branchiæ, a swim-bladder, four simple limbs, and a
long tail, all fitted for an organic life,” (p. 533); and Dr.
Dohrn conceives the original type to have contained
within itself all that has been subsequently evolved in
the highest vertebrate, the other and less elaborate organisms
being mere degradations from this type.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> This use
of the imagination, although not without advantages, is
also not without dangers. It may direct research, it must
not be suffered to replace research.</p>

<span class="subhead">SURVEY OF THE SYSTEM.</span></h2>

<p>1. <span class="firstword">Our</span> knowledge of mental processes is derived from
reflection on our personal experiences, combined with inferences
from our observation of other men and animals,
under similar conditions. The processes are complex and
variable; so complex and variable, that knowledge of
their component factors can only be gained through long
tentative study, aided by fortunate circumstances which
present these factors separately, or at any rate in such
marked predominance as to fix attention. This subjective
analysis of the <i>processes</i> has to be supplemented by,
and confirmed by an objective analysis of, the <i>conditions</i>,
external and internal: the facts of Feeling have to be
traced to facts of Physiology, which will exhibit that
Physical Basis of Mind so earnestly sought by the
inquirer.</p>

<p>Both the subjective and the objective analysis are at
present in a very imperfect state. Although there is
much confident assertion and “false persuasion of knowledge”
in both regions, there is, unhappily, little that can
be seriously accepted as demonstrated. In the present
volume we shall concern ourselves almost exclusively
with the objective analysis, and do our utmost to mark
what is mere inference from what is verified observation.
It is only by Observation that facts can be <i>settled</i>; however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Analogy and Inference may suggest where the truth
may lie, they are finger-posts, not goals. At the best
they only tell us what Observation <i>would</i> reveal could the
processes be submitted to Sense.</p>

<p>In a loose and general way every one knows that the
Nervous System is a dominant agent in all sentient processes;
although not by any means the only agent, yet,
because of its predominance, it is artificially accepted as
the only one. With the greater complexity of this system,
there is observed a corresponding increase in the
variety of sentient phenomena. The labors of anatomists
have secured a tolerably exact plan of the topographical
distribution of this system; a somewhat chaotic mass of
observation and inference passes as a description of its
elementary structure. The labors of physiologists have
succeeded to a small extent in localizing certain functions
in certain organs of this system. But imperfect as our
knowledge of the elementary structures is, our knowledge
of the functions is still more so. I wish I could say
otherwise, and that I could ask my readers to accept with
confidence what teachers confidently propound. The attitude
of scepticism is always repulsive; the sceptic is seldom
received without disfavor, because he throws on us
the labor of investigation there where we wish for the
confidence of knowledge. Yet it is only by facing the
facts that we can hope one day to solve the great questions.</p>

<p>2. The nervous system has, in our artificial view of it,
two divisions: the Peripheral, which connects the organism
with the external world; and the Central, which connects
each part of the organism with all the other parts.
Although the system is constituted by various tissues—neural,
connective, vascular, and elastic—it receives its
characteristic designation from nerve-fibrils, nerve-fibres,
and nerve-cells; just as the muscular system receives its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
designation from contractile cells and fibres. This neural
tissue assumes three well-marked forms: 1°, <i>nerves</i>, which
are bundles of fibres and fibrils, enclosed in a membranous
sheath; 2°, <i>ganglia</i>, which are clusters of cells, fibres,
and fibrils, sometimes enclosed in a sheath, sometimes
not; 3°, <i>centres</i>, which are artificial divisions of the neural
axis, serving as points of union for different organs.</p>

<p>In the Invertebrata the neural axis is the chain of
ganglionic masses running along the ventral side, and giving
off the nerves to organs of sense, and to the muscles.
It may be seen represented in
<a href="#ifig_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div id="ifig_1" class="figright" style="max-width: 12em;">

  <div class="captionl">

<p>Fig. 1.—<i>Nervous system of a
beetle.</i> The small round masses,
or <i>ganglia</i>, are seen to be connected
by longitudinal fibres,
and from the ganglia issue fibres
to the limbs, organs of sense, and
viscera.</p></div></div>

<p>In the Vertebrata the axis is
dorsal, and is called the <i>cerebro-spinal
axis</i>, including brain and
spinal cord. When we look at
this structure superficially we
see various nerves radiating <i>from</i>
it to skin, glands, and muscles;
but a closer examination, enlightened
by knowledge of function,
shows that some of these nerves
pass <i>into</i> it from the various surfaces
and sense-organs, and are
therefore called <i>afferent</i> or <i>sensory</i>;
whereas another set passes
out of it to glands and muscles, and these nerves are
therefore called <i>efferent</i> or <i>motory</i>. There are also fibres
which, passing from one part of the great centre to another,
are called <i>commissural</i>.</p>

<p>To this brief account of the cerebro-spinal system may
be added a word on the connected chain of ganglia and
nerves known as the Sympathetic, because it was formerly
supposed to be the organ through which the various
“sympathies” were effected. It is now held to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
system devoted to the viscera and blood-vessels; but
there is still great want of agreement among physiologists
as to whether it is an independent system, having a special
structure somewhat different from that of the cerebro-spinal,
or whether it is simply a great plexus of nerves
and ganglia, only topographically distinguishable from
the rest of the nervous system. Into this point it is unnecessary
for me to enter here. Enough to say, that I
entirely agree with Sigmund Mayer in adopting the second
view.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> In no histological character, yet specified,
are the sympathetic nerves and ganglia demarcated from
the others. There are, indeed, <i>more</i> non-medullary fibres
(the gray fibres of Remak) in the sympathetic; but the
same fibres are also abundant in the cerebro-spinal system;
and the sympathetic has also its large medullary
fibres.</p>

<p>3. The Centres are composed of two substances: the
gray and the white. The gray substance is often called
the vesicular because of its abundant cells; but it has
even more fibres than cells, and the white substance has
also a few cells.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> The gray substance is distributed over
the surface of the brain—in the convolutions; and in
various other parts of the encephalon. It surrounds the
central canal which forms the ventricles of the brain and
is continued as a very small cavity all down the spinal
cord. Besides entering into the important and conspicuous
masses known as the cerebral ganglia—(the <i>optic
thalami</i>, and <i>corpora striata</i>)—the gray substance is
massed in the <i>corpora quadrigemina</i>, <i>crura cerebri pons
varolii</i>, and <i>medulla oblongata</i>. We shall have occasion
to refer to each of those parts. Until modern times all
the masses included in the skull under the familiar term<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Brain (or the technical term Encephalon) were regarded
as the only centre, and also as the origin of all the nerves.
Nor has this notion even yet entirely disappeared, although
the spinal cord is known not to be a large nerve
trunk, but a centre or connected chain of centres, structurally
and functionally similar to the cranial centres.
The shadow of the ancient error still obscures interpretation
of the part this spinal cord plays in the sentient
mechanism; and thus although the cord is universally
admitted to be a centre for “sensitive impressions,”
it is usually excluded from Sensation. This widespread
and misleading notion will be critically examined in a
future problem.</p>

<p>4. Beginning our survey of the cerebro-spinal axis
with the Spinal Cord, we observe it to consist: 1°, of <i>central
gray substance</i> surrounding the scarcely visible canal,
which is all that remains of the primitive groove in the
germinal membrane (§ <a href="#II_9">9</a>); 2°, irregular gray masses,
called the <i>anterior and posterior horns</i>,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> connected with
the anterior and posterior <i>roots</i> of the spinal nerves; and
3°, strands of white fibres enclosing this central substance,
and called the <i>anterior lateral and posterior columns</i>.</p>

<p>Like the Cerebrum, it is a double organ formed by two
symmetrical halves, as the cerebrum is of two hemispheres.
Each half innervates the corresponding half of the body.
The cord is unlike the cerebrum in external form, though
very like it in internal structure. The gray structure is
mainly external in the cerebrum, and is internal in the
cord.</p>

<p>From the anterior side of the cord (that which in animals
is the under side) the motor nerves issue; from the
posterior (in animals the upper) side, issue the sensory
nerves. On each of the sensory nerves there is a ganglion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
The <i>roots</i> of each nerve, formed of several rootlets issuing
from the anterior and posterior columns, subsequently
unite together, and proceed in a single sheath to muscles
and skin, separating again, however, before they reach
muscles and skin. <a href="#ifig_2">Fig. 2</a> represents this arrangement.</p>

<p>5. There are thirty-one pairs (sometimes thirty-two)
of such nerves—namely, eight cervical, twelve thoracic,
five lumbar, five sacral, and one (or two) coccygeal. <a href="#ifig_3">Figs. 3</a> to <a href="#ifig_6">6</a>

<p>Although the Medulla Spinalis is unquestionably continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
as the Medulla Oblongata, the arrangement of its
tissues here becomes gradually changed, and so complicated
that it baffles the scalpel. Anatomists are, however,
agreed on the one point of fundamental importance to us
here—namely, that there is only a rearrangement, not
a new tissue. Accepting the artificial division into two
organs, we may say that their functions are different,
inasmuch as they are different in their anatomical connections—they
innervate different parts; but as nerve-centres
they have one and the same property.</p>

<p>On its posterior surface the Medulla Oblongata opens
as the <i>fourth ventricle</i>. It is then no longer a closed
canal, but an expansion of the spinal canal, which is
covered by the Cerebellum. On its anterior surface projects
the <i>pons varolii</i>. <a href="#ifig_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#ifig_8">8</a> represent these.</p>

<p>While thus on the one hand continuing the Medulla

to be continuous with the Brain—its white columns

<p>7. In man the Cerebrum is to the Cerebellum as 9 to
1. In the lower vertebrates the preponderance is still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
greater. The cerebrum is in our artificial systems commonly
divided into three lobes. The frontal lobe is that
portion which lies in front of the deep fissure named after
Rolando; between that fissure and the “internal perpendicular
fissure” lies the parietal lobe; behind this we
have the occipital lobe; and, below the fissure of Sylvius,
the tempero-sphenoidal lobe. Each lobe is again subdivided
according to its convolutions.</p>

<p>The disposition of the fibres in the brain is far too
complex to be accurately followed. All that we can say
is, that there are strands which connect one convolution
with another, strands which connect one hemisphere
with another, strands which connect cerebrum with cerebellum,
and strands which connect the cerebrum with
the lower ganglia. It is important to conceive this distinctly;
for we shall hereafter see that the function of
the Brain (by brain is here meant both Cerebrum and
Cerebellum) is not that of <i>innervation</i>, but of <i>incitation
and regulation</i>. To speak metaphorically, it is the coachman
who holds in his hands the reins, and guides the
team. One cardinal fact should arrest attention, namely,
that not a single nerve in the body has its origin or
centre of innervation in the cerebrum and cerebellum.
The olfactory and optic nerves do indeed <i>seem</i> to issue
from the cerebrum; and are commonly described as cerebral
nerves. But the facts of Development, minute
Anatomy, and Experiment prove this to be inexact.
Although I shall continue to speak of the olfactory and
optic nerves in accordance with universal usage, not
wishing to burden the reader with unnecessary innovations,
I must at the outset express my opinion that these
nerves cannot be brought under the same general type
as the other sensory nerves. Embryology and Anatomy
suggest that they have no more claim to the title than
the <i>crura cerebri</i>. Of this hereafter. Setting these aside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
no one now refuses to acknowledge that Cerebrum and
Cerebellum, although centres of Incitation and Association,
are not the centres of direct Innervation: the organic
mechanism in all its <i>physiological</i> processes will
act independently of them (so far as such artificial distinctions
are admissible at all). This does not throw
a doubt on their <i>physiological</i> functions, nor on their
participation in the normal execution of physiological
processes.</p>

<p>8. From this rapid survey two important points may
be selected for special attention. First, the continuity
of the neural axis throughout; secondly, the fundamental
similarity of its <i>structure</i>, underlying great variations in
its form and connections. This, which is the anatomical
expression of the Unity of the nervous system, will become
more evident after we have expounded what Embryology
and Microscopic Anatomy teach. We may
therefore digress here awhile to consider</p>

<h3 id="sec_11">THE EARLY FORMS OF NERVE CENTRES.</h3>

<p id="II_9">9. In the outermost layer of the germinal membrane
of the embryo a groove appears, which deepens as its
sides grow upwards, and finally close over and form a
canal. This canal is composed of cells all alike. Its
foremost extremity soon bulges into three well-marked
enlargements, which are then called the <i>primitive cerebral
vesicles</i>. The cavities of these vesicles are continuous.
Except in position and size, there are no discernible differences
in these vesicles, which are known as the Fore-brain,
Middle-brain, and Hind-brain.</p>

<p>10. The <i>Fore-brain</i> soon buds off from each side a
small vesicle. This is the optic vesicle, the first rudiment
of what subsequently becomes optic nerve and
retina. At this period it is simply a vesicle with a
hollow stem, the cavity being continuous with the cavity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of the cerebral vesicle, and the walls continuous with the
cerebral wall.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the retina and optic “nerve” are
primitive portions of the brain—a detached segment of
the general centre, identical in structure with the cerebral
vesicle, and not unlike in form. A cup-like depression
quickly forms the optic vesicle into an inner and an outer
fold. The inner or concave fold becomes the retina, and
the outer or convex fold (that nearest to the brain) becomes
its choroid membrane. On the fourth day of
incubation the retina of the chick is composed of spindle-shaped
cells, all alike. On the seventh day there is a
differentiation into layers, one of which on the eighth day
is granular; on the tenth two are granular; and on the
thirteenth ganglionic cells appear. Some of the cells
have elongated into radial fibres (known as Müller’s
fibres); and with the appearance of rods and cones the
normal retinal elements are complete.</p>

<p>11. The researches of Foster and Balfour<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> confirm
the statement that all the different parts of the retina
(whether nervous or connective) are derived from one
and the same layer of embryonic cells, which originally
formed a portion of the first cerebral vesicle.</p>

<p>12. Meanwhile the hollow stem of this optic vesicle
begins to develop fibres amidst the nuclei of its walls.
The “optic nerve” arises: it is still hollow; and in birds
remains so through life. The fibres as they are developed
<i>grow forwards towards the retina</i>, and spread over its internal
surface. <i>They also grow forwards towards the brain</i>,
and spread over its substance; but it is <i>not</i>, as might be
supposed, and is generally believed, with the cerebral
hemispheres (or that portion of the Fore-brain from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
these are derived), but with the Middle-brain (which
becomes the <i>corpora quadrigemina</i>), that the optic fibres
are in connection.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>13. This will be understood when the further development
is traced. The Fore-brain, after budding off the optic
vesicles, buds off two larger vesicles—the future cerebral
hemispheres. This is noticeable on the second day of
incubation, and by the third day each vesicle is as large
as the whole of the original Fore-brain. Their development
is essentially like that of the optic vesicles; both as
to the cellular and the fibrous elements.</p>

<p>The <i>convolutions</i>, <i>corpus callosum</i>, <i>nucleus lentiformis</i>,
and <i>corpora striata</i> are then indicated. Meanwhile, that
which originally was the Fore-brain has lapsed into the
secondary rank as Intermediate-brain (<i>Zwischenhirn</i>), and
becomes the parts surrounding the third ventricle, namely,
the <i>thalami</i>, <i>corpora candicantia</i>, <i>infundibulum</i>, and what
is called the “posterior perforated substance.”</p>

<p>14. The <i>Middle-brain</i>, or Second Vesicle, develops the
<i>corpora quadrigemina</i> from the roof of its cavity, and the
<i>crura cerebri</i> from its floor.</p>

<p>The <i>Hind-brain</i>, or Third Vesicle, divides into two, like
the First Vesicle; it buds off the hemispheres of the cerebellum;
its cavity forms the fourth ventricle; its walls
the <i>medulla oblongata</i>.</p>

<p>15. It thus appears that the primitive membrane forms
into a canal, which enlarges at one part into three vesicles,
and from these are developed the encephalic structures.
The continuity of the walls and cavities of these vesicles
is never obliterated throughout the subsequent changes.
It is also traceable throughout the medulla spinalis. And
microscopic investigation reveals that underneath all the
morphological changes the walls of the whole cerebro-spinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
axis are composed of similar elements on a similar
plan.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>16. Two conclusions directly follow from this exposition:—first,
that <i>since the structure of the great axis is
everywhere similar, the properties must be similar</i>; secondly,
that <i>since there is structural continuity, no one part
can be called into activity without at the same time more or
less exciting that of all the rest</i>.</p>

<h3 id="sec_12">THE PERIPHERAL SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>17. Following the analytical division, we now come to
the Peripheral System of nerves and ganglia. The separation,
I must often repeat, is purely artificial; but the
artifice has conveniences. We separate in the same way
the heart from veins and arteries, and the capillary circulation
from the arterial.</p>

<p>Each nerve has its direct connection with a particular
centre, and indirectly with the whole system. It has its
circumscribed territory, and individual office. Except in
a few cases of anastomosis, the action of one nerve does
not involve that of another: only one muscle or one
group of muscles is moved, without exciting motion in a
neighbor. It is through the centres that these individual
territories are united; and a wave of excitation always
passes throughout the central substance. Thus the centres
are not simply organs of association, consequently of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
regulation, but are the nexus whereby the diversity of the
actions is integrated into the unity of consensus.</p>

<p>18. Nothing further need at present be stated respecting
the nerves; but it is needful to give precision to the
ideas of</p>

<h3 id="sec_13">GANGLIA AND CENTRES,</h3>

<p class="in0">usually spoken of as if they were convertible terms. That
this is inexact may be readily shown, and that it is misleading
appears in its causing physiologists to credit
every ganglion, wherever found, with central functions;
and, by an almost inevitable extension of the error, has
led to the assignment of central functions to a single
ganglionic cell! This is but part of that “superstition
of the cell” against which I shall have to protest. I will
not here raise the doubt which presses from various sides
respecting the central functions of the ganglia in the
heart and intestines, because the reader perhaps shares
the general opinion on that point; but let me simply ask
what central function can possibly be assigned to the
ganglia on each of the spinal sensory nerves? above all to
those grouped and scattered ganglionic cells which are
found at the peripheral termination of some nerves, and
in the very trunks of others? There may, indeed, be
imagined a central function for the ganglia in the mesentery,
and even in the choroid coat of the retina, on the
hypothesis (quite gratuitous, I think) of their regulating
the circulation; but even this explanation cannot be
adopted with respect to the ganglionic cells which appear
in the course of the nerve.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
The meaning of a physiological centre is, that it is a
point <i>to</i> which stimulations proceed, and <i>from</i> which they
are reflected. The meaning of a ganglion is, that it is a
group of nerve cells dispersed among, or in continuation
with, nerve fibres: it may be a centre of reflection, or it
may not; and in the latter case its physiological office is
at present undetermined. A ganglion is no more a centre
in virtue of its cell-group than a muscle is a limb. All
function depends on connection, and central function demands
a connection of afferent and efferent parts.</p>

<p>19. The ganglia found in the ventral cord of the Invertebrate
(see <a href="#ifig_1">Fig. 1</a>) are centres, each of which has considerable
independence, each regulating a single segment of
the body, or a group of similar segments. As the scale
of animal complexity ascends, these separated centres tend
more and more to coalesce, and with this coalescence
comes an increasing <i>combination</i> of movements.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Observe
the caterpillar slowly crawling over a leaf; each
segment of its body moves in succession; but when this
caterpillar becomes a butterfly the body moves rapidly,
and all at once. Open the caterpillar, and you find its
nervous centres are thirteen separate ganglia, each presiding
over a distinct part of the body, and each capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
independent action. Open the butterfly, and you find the
thirteen ganglia greatly changed: the second and third
are fused into one; the fourth, fifth, and sixth into
another; the eleventh and twelfth into another; the only
trace of the original separation is in a slight constriction
of the surface. The movements of the caterpillar were
few, simple, slow, and those of the butterfly are many,
varied, and rapid.</p>

<p>20. In the Vertebrates the coalescence of ganglia is
such that the spinal axis is one great centre. We do
indeed anatomically and physiologically subdivide it into
several centres, because several portions directly innervate
separate organs; but its importance lies in the intimate
blending of all parts, so that <i>fluctuating combinations</i> of
its elements may arise, and varied movements result.
Each centre combines various muscles; the axis is a combination
of centres. The brainless frog, for instance, has
still the spinal cord, and therefore the power not only of
moving either of his limbs, but also of combining their
separate movements: if grasped, he struggles and escapes;
if pricked, he hops away. But these actions, although
complex, are much less complex and varied than the actions
of the normal frog.</p>

<p>There is not only a coalescence of ganglia, but a greater
and greater concentration of the substance in the upper
portions of the axis. In the inferior vertebrates, and in
the mammalian embryo, the spinal cord occupies the
whole length of the vertebral canal from the head to the
tip of the tail; and here the centres of reflexion correspond
with the several segments. But as the cranial
mass develops there is a withdrawal of neural substance
from the lower parts, and the centres of reflexion are then
some way removed from the segments they innervate. In
the animal development there is even a greater and
greater predominance of the upper portions, so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
brain and medulla oblongata are of infinitely more importance
than the spinal cord.</p>

<p>21. Besides the central group of elements which belong
to fixed and definite actions, we must conceive these elements
capable of variable combinations, like the pieces
of colored glass in a kaleidoscope, which fall into new
groups, each group having its definite though temporary
form. The elements constitute really a continuous network
of variable forms. It is to such combinations, and
not to fixed circumscribed ganglia, that we must refer the
subordinate centres of the axis. We speak of a centre
for Respiration, a centre for Laughing, a centre for Crying,
a centre for Coughing, and so on, with as much propriety
as we speak of a centre for Swallowing or for
Walking. Not that in these cases there is a circumscribed
mass of central substance set apart for the innervation of
the several muscles employed in these actions, and for no
other purpose. Each action demands a definite group of
neural elements, as each geometric form in the kaleidoscope
demands a definite group of pieces of glass; but
these same pieces of glass will readily enter into other
combinations; and in like manner the muscles active in
Respiration are also active in Laughing, Coughing, etc.,
though differently innervated and co-ordinated.</p>

<p>22. The physiological rank of a centre is therefore the
expression of its power of fluctuating combination. The
medulla oblongata is higher than the medulla spinalis,
because of its more varied combinations; the cerebrum is
higher than all, because it has no fixed and limited combinations.
It is the centre of centres, and as such the
supreme organ.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>23. <span class="firstword">The</span> distinguishable parts of this system are the
central axis, the cranial nerves, and the spinal nerves, with
the chain of ganglia and nerves composing the Sympathetic.
Let us briefly set down what is known of their
special offices.</p>

<p>Men very early discovered that the nerves were in some
way ministrant to Sensation and Movement; a divided
nerve always being accompanied by insensibility and immobility
in the limb. Galen, observing that paralysis of
movement sometimes occurred without insensibility, suggested
that there were two kinds of nerve; but no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
was able to furnish satisfactory evidence in support of
this suggestion until early in the present century, when
the experiments of Charles Bell, perfected by those of
Majendie and Müller, placed the suggestion beyond dispute.</p>

<div id="ifig_12" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="370" height="339" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 12.—<i>Transverse sections of spinal cord (dorsal region).</i></div></div>

<p>24. <a href="#ifig_12">Fig. 12</a> is a <i>diagram</i> (not a drawing of the actual
aspect, which would be hardly intelligible to readers unversed
in such matters) representing two transverse sections
of the spinal cord just where the nerve-roots issue.
The gray substance is somewhat in the form of a rude H,
in the dorsal region, and of the expanded wings of a butterfly
in the lumbar enlargements (Figs. 4–6); the extremities
of this gray substance are the <i>anterior and posterior
horns</i>. We have already said that from the anterior horns
of each half issue the roots of the motor nerves, which
pass to the muscles. From the posterior horns issue the
sensory nerves, which, soon after leaving the cord, enter
the ganglia before joining the motor nerves, and then pass
to the skin, in the same sheath with their companions,
separating again as they reach the muscles and surfaces
where they are to be distributed. When this mixed nerve
is cut through, or tied, all sensation and movement disappear
from the parts innervated. But if only one of the
roots be cut through, above the ganglion, there will then
be only a loss of movement or a loss of sensation. Thus
suppose the section be made at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, A: we have then
divided a sensory nerve, and no pinching or pricking of
the part innervated by that nerve will be felt; but movement
will take place if the under nerve be irritated, or if
a sensation <i>elsewhere</i> be excited. Now reverse the experiment,
as at B, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. Then, pricking of the skin will be
felt, but no movement will respond. The nerve which
enters the cord at the upper (posterior) part is therefore a
sensory nerve; that which enters at the under (anterior)
part is motor. The direction is in each case indicated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the arrow. The central end <i>b</i>, if irritated, will produce
sensation; whereas the peripheral end <i>a</i> produces neither
sensation nor movement. The central end <i>d</i> produces
neither sensation nor movement; the peripheral end <i>c</i>
produces movement.</p>

<p>25. Two facts are proved by these experiments. First,
that the co-operation of the centre is necessary for Sensation,
but not for Movement. Although normally all the
muscles of the trunk are moved only when their centre
has been excited, yet any irritation applied directly to the
muscle nerve, even when separated from its centre, produces
a movement. And to this we may add that a
slighter stimulus will move the muscle by direct irritation
of the nerve, than by indirect irritation through the
centre; a slighter stimulus also will suffice when applied
to the nerve than when applied to the muscle itself.</p>

<p id="II_26">26. The second fact proved is known as <i>Bell’s Law</i>,
that the sensory and motor channels are respectively the
posterior and anterior nerves. The fact is indisputable,
but its theoretic interpretation can no longer be accepted
in its original form. Bell supposed the two nerves to be
different in kind, endowed with different specific energies,
the one sensitive, the other motor. The majority of writers
still express themselves as if they adopted this view.
We shall, however, presently see reason for replacing it
by the more consistent interpretation which assigns one
and the same property to both nerves, marking their distinction
by the terms afferent and efferent; the one set
being anatomically so disposed that it conveys stimuli
from the surfaces to the centre, and the other set conveying
stimuli from the centre to the muscles, glands, and
other cells.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
27. Bell’s discovery was rapidly generalized. The
principle of localization was extended to all nerves, and
of course to the posterior and anterior columns of the
spinal cord, which indeed were assumed to be continuations
of the nerves. Bell, who was greater as an anatomist
than as a philosopher, always maintained that anatomical
deduction was superior to experiment. But this
was to misunderstand the reach of deduction, which is
only valid to the extent of its premises.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> In the present
case, the premises assumed that the posterior columns
were continuations of the posterior roots, and carried
impressions to the brain, the anterior columns carrying
back from the brain the “mandates of the will.” Experiment
has, however, decisively shown that it is <i>not</i> through
the posterior columns that sensory impressions travel to
the brain, but through the central gray substance.</p>

<p>28. The spinal cord with its central gray substance is
at each point a centre of reflexion. Connected as it is
with different organs, we artificially consider it as a chain
of different centres, and try to detect the functional relations
of its parts. The inquiry is important, but we
must bear in mind the cardinal principle that diversity of
Function depends on the organs innervated, and not on a
diversity of Property in the nervous tissue. Although
all nerves have a common structure and common property,
yet we distinguish them as sensory and motor; and
the sensory we subdivide into those of Special Sensation
and those of Systemic Sensation. The motor we divide
into muscular, vasomotor, and glandular. The hypothesis
of specific energies must be relinquished (§ <a href="#II_63">63</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
In like manner all centres have a common structure
and a common property, with a great diversity of functional
relations. Here also the hypothesis of specific
energies has been generally adopted, owing to a mistaken
conception of the biological principle just mentioned.
The cerebral hemispheres are credited with the properties
of sensation, thought, and volition; the cerebellum with
the property of muscular co-ordination; the spinal cord
with the property of reflexion.</p>

<p id="II_29">29. No attempt to assign the true functional relations
of the centres will be made at the present stage of our
exposition. We must learn more of the processes in Sensation,
Thought, and Volition, before we can unravel the
complex physiological web on which they depend. But
here, provisionally, may be set down what observation
and experiment have disclosed respecting the part played
by certain centres. We know, for example, that when
the cerebral hemispheres are carefully removed from a
reptile or a bird, all the essentially <i>vital</i> functions go on
pretty much as before, but a great disturbance in some
of the <i>psychical</i> functions is observed. The brainless bird
eats, drinks, sleeps, moves its limbs separately and in
combination, manifests sensibility to light, sound, and
touch, performs such instinctive actions as preening its
feathers, or thrusting the head under the wing while
roosting. Throw it into the air and it will fly. In its
flight it will avoid obstacles, and will alight upon a ledge,
or your shoulder. But it will not fly unless thrown into
the air; it will not escape through the open door or window;
it will avoid objects, but will show no fear of them,—alighting
on your head, for example, without hesitation.
It is sensitive to light, and may in a certain sense
be said to <i>see</i>; but it fails to <i>perceive</i> what is <i>seen</i>. It will
eat and drink, if food and water be administered, but it
will starve near a heap of grain and never peck it, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
even if the beak be thrust into the heap. A grain, or
strip of meat, may be thrust inside the beak; there it will
remain unswallowed, unless it touches the back of the
mouth, then swallowing at once follows the stimulus.
The bird <i>with</i> its brain will fly away if you turn the
finger, or stick, on which it is perching; <i>without</i> its
brain, it makes no attempt to fly, but flutters its wings,
and balances itself. If you open the mouth of a cat, or
rabbit, and drop in some bitter fluid, the animal closes its
mouth firmly, and resists your efforts to repeat the act;
without its brain, the animal shows the same disgust
at the taste, but never resists the preliminaries of the
repetition.</p>

<p>30. These, and analogous facts, have been noted by
various experimenters. They are very far from proving
what is usually concluded; but they prove the important
negative position that the cerebrum is not the centre of
innervation for any of the organs on which the observed
actions depend. Thus, the cerebrum is not necessary to
sight: <i>ergo</i> it does not innervate the eye. It is not necessary
to hearing: <i>ergo</i> it does not innervate the ear.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> It
is not necessary to breathing, swallowing, flying, etc.:
<i>ergo</i> it does not innervate the organs of these functions.</p>

<p>What then is lost? We have only to remember that
the cerebrum is continuous with the thalami and corpora
striata, and, through its crura, with the medulla oblongata
and medulla spinalis, to foresee that its removal
must more or less affect the whole neural axis, and consequently
disturb the actions of the whole organism; this
disturbance will often have the appearances which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
be due to the removal of a central apparatus, so that we
shall be apt to attribute the cessation of a function to the
loss of its organ, when in fact the cessation is due simply
to an arrest of the organ by irritation. Thus the cessation
of consciousness, or of any particular movements,
when the cerebrum is removed, is no decisive proof that
the cerebrum is the organ of consciousness, or of the
movement in question. This point will be duly considered
hereafter. What we have now to consider is the
facts observed after removal of the cerebrum.</p>

<p>First, we observe a loss of that power of combining
present states with past states, present feelings with feelings
formerly excited in conjunction with them, the
power which enables the animal to adjust its actions
to certain sensations <i>now unfelt</i> but which <i>will be</i> felt in
consequence of the adjustment. Secondly, we observe a
loss of Spontaneity: the bird, naturally mobile and alert,
now sits moveless for hours in a sort of stupor, occasionally
preening its feathers, but rarely quitting its resting-place.
All the most conspicuous phenomena which we
assign to Intelligence and Will seem absent. The sensations
are altered and diminished. Many Instincts have
disappeared, but some remain. The sexual feeling is
preserved, although the bird has lost all power of directing
its actions so as to gratify the desire. But these
effects are only observed when the whole of both hemispheres
have been removed. If a small portion remain
the bird retains most of its faculties, though with less
energy. In frogs and fishes there is little discernible
effect observed when a large portion of the cerebrum is
removed.</p>

<p>31. Now take away from this mutilated bird its cerebellum:
all the functions continue as before except that
<i>some</i> combined movements can no longer be effected;
flight is impossible; walking is a mere stagger. Remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
only the lateral lobes, and though flight is still possible
great <i>incoherence</i> of the wings is observed, whereas walking
is not much affected. If only the cerebellum be
removed, the cerebrum being intact, the phenomena are
very different. All the perceptions and almost all the
emotions, all the spontaneity and vivacity are retained;
but the sexual instinct, which was manifested when the
cerebrum was removed, is now quite gone. What we
call Intelligence seems unaffected. The bird hears, and
understands the meaning of the sounds, sees and perceives,
sees and fears, sees and adjusts its movements
with a mental vision of unseen consequences.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>32. Are we from these facts to conclude that the cerebrum
is the “organ of the mind”; that it is “the seat”
of sensation, thought, emotion, volition; and that the cerebellum
is the “seat” of the sexual instinct, and muscular
co-ordination? Such conclusions have found acceptance,
even from physiologists who would have been startled
had any one ventured to affirm that the medulla oblongata
was the “organ” of Respiration, because Respiration
ceases when this centre is destroyed. I shall have to
combat this notion at various stages of my exposition.
Here let me simply say that it is irreconcilable with any
clear conception of organ and function; and is plainly
irreconcilable with any survey of psychical phenomena
in animals in whom the cerebrum does not exist, and
in animals from whom it has been removed.</p>

<p>What the facts indisputably prove is that the cerebrum
has an important part in the mechanism by which
the most complex psychical combinations are effected,
and that the cerebellum has an important part in the
mechanism by which the most complex muscular combinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
are effected. The supreme importance of the
cerebrum may be inferred from its dominating all the
other centres, and from its preponderance in size. In
man it stands to all the other cranial centres together in
the relation of 11 to 3. It is about five times as heavy
as the spinal cord—that is to say from 1,100 to 1,400
grammes, compared with 27 to 30 grammes. The quantity
of blood circulating through it is immense. Haller
estimated the cranial circulation as one fifth of the whole
circulation. If, therefore, the Nervous Centres are agents
in the production of Sensation and Intelligence, by far
the largest share must be allotted to the cranial centres,
and of these the largest to the Cerebrum.</p>

<p>33. It is, however, one thing to recognize the Cerebrum
as having an important part in the production of
psychical phenomena, another thing to localize all the
phenomena in it as their organ and seat—a localization
which soon becomes even more absurd, when of all the
cerebral structure the multipolar cells alone are admitted
as the active agents!</p>

<p>As was said just now, we recognize in the Medulla
Oblongata the nervous centre of Respiration, but we do
not suppose that Respiration has its <i>seat</i> there, nor that
this centre is absolutely indispensable for the essential
part of the process. We respire by our skin, as well as
by our lungs; many animals respire who have nothing
like a medulla oblongata; as many animals feel, and
manifest will, who have nothing like a cerebrum. The
destruction of centres is of course a disturbance of the
mechanisms which they regulate. But even the observed
results of a destruction require very close examination,
and are liable to erroneous interpretations. The disappearance
of a function following the destruction, or disease
of a particular part, is not to be accepted as a proof that
this part is the organ of the lost function; because precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the same phenomena may often be observed following
the destruction of a totally different part.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> But one
result may always be relied on, and that is the <i>persistence</i>
of a function after removal of a particular part. Thus
there is a certain spot of the cerebral convolutions from
which movements of the limbs are excited when the
electrodes are applied to it; removal of the substance is
immediately followed by paralysis of the limbs. Are
we to conclude that this spot is the organ of the function?
It is true that the function is called into action
by a stimulus applied to this spot: true that the function
suddenly vanishes when the substance of this spot
is destroyed. Nevertheless, what seems a loss of function
is only a disturbance. In two or three days the
paralysis begins to disappear, and at the end of a week
the limbs are moved nearly in the normal manner. And
the same is true when the spot in question is destroyed
on both sides. The recovery of the function shows that
the absent part was not its organ. There is a paradoxical
experiment recorded by M. Paul Bert which may be cited
here. He removed the right cerebral hemisphere from a
chameleon, and found that the limbs on the left side were
paralyzed; but on his then removing the left cerebral
hemisphere the limbs of the left side recovered their
activity. A similar result was obtained by Lussana and
Lemoigne by extirpation of the thalami. When we find
combined movements persisting after the cerebellum has
been destroyed, we may be sure that the cerebellum is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
not the organ by which such combinations take place; and
when we find sensation and volition manifested after the
cerebrum has been removed, we may be sure that the cerebrum
is not the organ for these sensations and volitions.</p>

<p>34. And this we do find. Physiologists, indeed, for
the most part, deny it; or rather, while they admit the
observed facts, they refuse to admit the only consistent
interpretation, biassed as they are by the traditional conception
of the brain. After having for many years persistently
denied Sensibility to any centre except the cerebrum,
they are now generally agreed in including the
medulla oblongata within the privileged region; but they
still exclude the medulla spinalis.</p>

<p>35. If all the cranial centres as far as the medulla
oblongata are removed from young rabbits, dogs, or cats,
there are unmistakable evidences of Sensibility in their
<i>cries</i> when their tails are pinched, their <i>moving jaws</i> (as
in mastication) when bitters are placed in their mouths,
and their <i>raised paws rubbing their noses</i>, when irritating
vapors are applied. It is said indeed that the cries are
no signs of <i>pain</i>; and this is probable; but they are
assuredly signs of Sensibility.</p>

<p>35. The frog thus mutilated has lost indeed all its special
senses, except Touch, but it still breathes, struggles
when grasped, thrusts aside the pincers which irritate it,
or wipes away acid dropped on its skin. If the eye be
lightly touched, the eyelid closes; if the touch be repeated
three or four times, the foreleg is raised to push the irritant
away; if still repeated, the head is turned aside; but
however prolonged the irritation, the frog neither hops,
nor crawls away, as he does when the cerebellum remains.
Place the brainless frog on his back, and if the medulla
oblongata remains he will at once regain the normal position;
but if that part is absent he will lie helpless on his
back. The power of preserving equilibrium in difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
positions—which of course implies a nice co-ordination
of muscles—resides in the so-called <i>optic lobes</i> of the frog
(what in mammals are called the <i>corpora quadrigemina</i>).</p>

<p>37. With the destruction of each part of the central
mass there will necessarily be some disturbance of the
mechanism; but difficult as may be the task of detecting
by experiment what is the normal action of any one part,
there ought to be no hesitation in recognizing the persistence
of functions after certain parts are destroyed. The
spinal cord is anatomically known to be the centre from
which the limbs, trunk, and genito-urinary organs are
innervated. So long as the mechanism of the actions involving
such organs is intact, no removal of other parts
will prevent this mechanism from exhibiting its normal
action. There may indeed arise, and there has arisen, the
doubt whether Sensibility is involved in the action of
any nerve centre below the medulla oblongata. But this
doubt is founded on the traditional hypothesis respecting
the seat of Sensation, and is flagrantly at variance with
the logical conclusions of Anatomy and Experiment.</p>

<p>38. Anatomy shows that the structure of the spinal
cord is in all essential characters the same as that of the
medulla oblongata; and indeed that the whole central
axis has one continuous tissue, somewhat variously arranged,
and in relation with various organs.</p>

<p>Abundant Experiment has shown that the spinal cord,
apart from the encephalon, is capable of acting as a sensorial
and volitional centre. The striking facts advanced
by Pflüger, Auerbach, and myself, have not been impugned;<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
but their interpretation has been generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
rejected. We showed that a brainless frog responded to
stimulation in actions which bore so close a resemblance
to actions admitted to be sensorial and volitional—showed
the frog <i>adapting</i> itself to new conditions, and <i>acquiring</i>
dexterity in executing actions which at first were impossible
or difficult, <i>devising</i> combinations to effect a purpose
which never by any possibility could have formed part of
its habits—manifesting, in a word, such signs of Sensibility,
that no one witnessing the experiments could hesitate
as to the interpretation, had he not been biassed by
the traditions of the schools.</p>

<p>39. Our opponents argued that in spite of all appearances
there were profound differences between the actions of
the normal and the brainless animal, and that the latter were
due simply to Reflex Action. I also insist on profound
differences; but underlying these there are fundamental
identities. As to the Reflex Action, two points will hereafter
be brought forward: 1°, that <i>all</i> central action is
reflex, the cerebral no less than the spinal; 2°, that the
hypothesis of Reflex Action being purely <i>mechanical</i>, and
distinguished from Voluntary Action in not involving Sensibility,
is an hypothesis which must be relinquished.</p>

<p>40. Postponing, however, all discussion of these points,
let me here say that the doctrine maintained in these
pages is that the whole cerebro-spinal axis is a centre of
Reflexion, its various segments taking part in the performance
of different kinds of combined action. It has
one common property, Sensibility; and different parts of
it minister to different functions—the optic centre being
different from the auditory, the cerebral from the spinal;
and so on. To make this intelligible, however, we must
first learn what is known respecting the properties of
nerve-tissue.</p>

<span class="subhead">NEURILITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>41. <span class="firstword">Observation</span> having found that the activity of a
nerve was always followed by a sensation when the nerve
ended in a centre, and by a movement when the nerve
ended in a muscle, Theory was called upon to disclose the
nature of this peculiar property of nerves. That a peculiar
and mysterious power did act in the nerves no one
doubted; the only doubt was as to its nature. The ancient
hypothesis of Animal Spirits seemed all that was
needed. The spirits coursed along the nerves, and obeyed
the mandates of the Soul. When this hypothesis fell
into discredit, its place was successively taken by the hypotheses
of Nervous Fluid, Electricity, and Nerve Force.
The Fluid, though never manifested to Sense, was firmly
believed in, even so late as the days of Cuvier;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> but
when the so-called electrical currents were detected in
nerves, and the nervous phenomena were shown to resemble
electrical phenomena, there was a general agreement
in adopting the electrical hypothesis. The brain then
took the place of a galvanic battery; the nerves were its
electrodes.</p>

<p id="II_42">42. Closer comparison of the phenomena detected various
irreconcilable differences, which, if they proved nothing
else, proved that nerve-action took place under conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
so special as to demand a special designation.
Electricity itself is so little understood, that until its
nature is more precisely known, we cannot confidently
say more than that nerve-action resembles electrical-action;
meanwhile the speciality of neural conditions renders
all deduction illusory which is based on electrical-action
as observed under <i>other</i> conditions. In presence
of these difficulties, cautious physiologists content themselves
with assigning the observed phenomena to the
observed and inferred conditions, condensing these in the
convenient symbol “nerve-force,” without pretending to
any specification of the nature of that force. It may be
a wave of molecular movement dependent on isometric
change or on metamorphic change. It may be the liberation
of molecular tension resembling electricity; it may be
electricity itself. But whatever the nature of the change,
it is an activity of the tissue, and as such comes under
the general dynamic conception of Force or Energy.</p>

<p>43. In this sense the term has nothing equivocal or
obscure. It is a shorthand expression symbolizing certain
well-defined observations. Nevertheless, it is a term
which we shall do well to avoid when possible, and to
replace by another having less danger of misinterpretation;
the reason being that Force has become a sort of
shibboleth, and a will-o’-wisp to speculative minds. All
that we <i>know</i> of Force is Motion. But this is too meagre
for metempirical thinkers, who disdain the familiar experiences
expressed in the term Motion, and demand a transcendent
cause “to account” for what is observed. They
seek an entity to account for the fact. Motion is a very
definite conception, expressing precise experiences; we
know what it means, and know that the laws of moving
bodies admit of the nicest calculation. A similar precision
belongs to Force when understood as “mass acceleration,”
or M V². But this does not content those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
metaphysicians who understand by Force “the unknown
reality behind the phenomena”—the <i>cause</i> of Motion.
This cause they refuse to recognize in some antecedent
motion (what I have termed a “differential pressure”),
but demand for it a physical or metaphysical <i>agent</i>: the
physical agent being a subtle fluid of the nature of Ether,
or a nerve atmosphere surrounding the molecules; the
metaphysical agent being a Spirit or aggregate of Soul-atoms.
The second alternative we may decline here to
discuss. The first alternative is not only a pure fiction,
but one which is inconsistent with the demonstrable
velocity of the neural process, which is not greater than
the pace of a greyhound, whereas the velocities of light
and electricity are enormously beyond this. It is inconsistent
also with the observation that a much feebler current
of electricity is requisite for the stimulation of a
muscle through its nerve than when directly applied to
the muscle: a proof that the nerve does not act solely
by transmission of electricity—unless we gratuitously assume
that the nerve is a multiplicator.</p>

<p>When it is said that the living nerve is incessantly liberating
Force which can be communicated to other tissues,
the statement is acceptable only if we reject the metaphysical
conceptions it will too generally suggest—the
conceptions of Force as an entity, and of its being passed
from one object to another like an arrow shot from a bow.
The physical interpretation simply says that the molecules
of the nerve are incessantly vibrating, and with
varying sweep; these vibrations, when of a certain energy,
will set going vibrations in another substance by
disturbing the tension of its molecules, as the vibrations
of heat will disturb the tension of the gunpowder molecules,
and set them sweeping with greater energy: this is
the <i>communication</i> of the force. Just as we say that a
magnet communicates magnetic force to a bit of iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
though all we mean is that the magnet has so altered the
molecular condition of the iron as to have given it the
movements called magnetism—in short, has excited in
the iron the dormant property of becoming magnetic—so
we say the nerve communicates its force to the muscle,
exciting in the muscle its dormant property of contraction.
But in truth nothing has passed from magnet to
iron, or from nerve to muscle.</p>

<p>44. Do what we will, however, there is always, in the
present condition of philosophical chaos, the danger of
being misunderstood when we employ the term Nerve-force;
and I have proposed the term Neurility as an
escape from the misleading suggestions. It is a symbol
expressing the general property of nerve-tissue. For reasons
presently to be stated, I restrict Neurility to the
peripheral system, employing Sensibility for the central
system. The excited muscle manifests its special property
of Contractility; the excited nerve manifests its
special property of Neurility; the excited centre manifests
its special property of Sensibility.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The terms are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
simply descriptive, and carry with them no hypothesis as
to <i>what</i> Neurility is in its hidden process, nor <i>how</i> Sensibility
arises in a nerve-centre, and not elsewhere. We
know that a stimulated muscle contracts, and we express
the fact by assigning to muscular tissue the property of
Contractility. We know that a stimulated nerve translates
an impulse from one point to another, and excites
the muscle to contract; and we express the fact by assigning
to nerve-tissue the property of transmitting stimulation,
which is further specified, as unlike other transmissions,
by the term Neurility.</p>

<p>45. What is the meaning attached to the term Property,
and how it is distinguished from Function, has been
already expounded in Problem 1, §§ <a href="#II_81">81–6</a>. There also
was laid down the principle of <i>identity of structure implying
identity of property</i>. Inasmuch as observation reveals
a fundamental similarity in the structure of the nervous
tissue throughout the animal kingdom, we must conclude
the existence of a fundamental similarity in the property
of that tissue: a conclusion confirmed by observation.
There is a corresponding agreement in the organs and
functions; so that, within certain limits, the experiments
performed on an insect may be verified on a mammal.
Everywhere nerve-tissue has certain characters in common,
accompanied by variations in the degree and mode
of manifestation corresponding with variations in structure
and connection. Obvious as the fact is, we must
emphasize the great variety which accompanies the underlying
uniformity, for this is recognizable both in the
individual organism and in the animal kingdom at large.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Even such seemingly individual terms as nerve-cell and
nerve-fibre are in truth generic; and the description which
accurately represents one cell or fibre needs modifying for
others.</p>

<p>Properties are generalized expressions; they result from
the <i>composition</i>, the <i>structure</i>, and the <i>texture</i> of a substance.
Thus one bar of iron may differ from another of
equal bulk in being more or less crystalline in structure,
though having the same composition and the same texture.
This difference will modify the mode of manifestation
of the iron-properties. Cast-iron pillars, for example,
will support, as a roof, a weight which would
break them if suspended; wrought-iron pillars of similar
bulk will bear a weight suspended which would crush
them as a roof. Yet both cast and wrought iron pillars
have the same properties, because they have the <i>same</i>
composition and <i>similar</i> structure; the variation of structure
only producing a difference in the modes. Texture
may also vary. The bar of iron may be beaten into a
plate, rolled into a cylinder, or split into wire-work, without
any change in its properties, but with marked differences
in its modes of manifestation, and in the <i>uses</i>
to which it may be applied. These uses are of course
dependent on the connections established between the
iron and other things. In Physiology, <i>uses</i> are called
<i>functions</i>.</p>

<p>46. Nerve-tissue must be understood as having everywhere
the same general Property. In one animal and in
another, in one part and in another, Neurility is the same
in kind, but not everywhere manifesting the same degree,
nor applied to the same Function. The <i>composition</i> of
nerve-tissue varies, but not more than the composition of
all other organized substances; the <i>structure</i> is variable,
but only within a small range; the <i>texture</i> also; while the
<i>connections</i> are very various. Hence, whatever the variations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
in composition or structure, the nerve-fibre has everywhere
one fundamental property, which in connection with
a muscle has the functional activity of exciting contraction;
in connection with a gland of exciting secretion;
and in connection with a centre of exciting reflexion.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>47. Had a clear idea of Function as dependent on connexion
been present to their minds certain physiologists
would hardly have raised the mirage of “Nerve-force,” a
mysterious entity endowed with “specific energies,” and
capable of producing vital and psychical phenomena by
an occult process; nor would others have been led to the
monstrous hypothesis of particular nerve-cells being endowed
with thought, instinct, and volition. They would
have sought an explanation of functions in the combined
properties of the co-operant organs and tissues. They
would not have endowed one nerve with Sensibility, and
another nerve of identical structure with Motility;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> one
nerve with a motor property, and another with the opposite
property of inhibition. They would have seen that
all nerves have the same <i>property</i>, but different <i>uses</i> when
in different connexions.</p>

<p>48. Throughout the animal kingdom we see movement
following on stimulation. Stimulation may be defined
the change of molecular equilibrium. The stimulation
of a muscle is produced indirectly through a change in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the nerve, or directly through a change in the muscle
itself. In the simplest organisms there is no trace of
nerve-tissue; but their substance manifests Irritability
(or as it is often called Sensibility); and a stimulus to
one part is propagated throughout—the whole body
moves when touched. Even in Polypes, where there is
the beginning of a differentiation, the motion is slowly
propagated from one part to the rest. A single tentacle
retracts when touched; but the movement rarely ends
there; it is slowly communicated from one tentacle to
the other, and from them to the whole mass. Touching
the body, however, will not, if the touch be slight, cause
the tentacles to move; so that we see here a beginning
of that principle of specialization which is so manifest in
the higher organisms: the tentacles have become the
specially sensitive parts. Ascending higher in the scale
of organisms we find those which habitually move particular
parts without at the same time necessarily moving
the rest; and this independence of parts, accompanying
a more perfect consensus, we find to be developed <i>pari
passu</i> with a nervous system. An immense variety of
part-movements, with varying combinations of such movements,
is the physiological expression of the more complex
nervous system.</p>

<p>48 <i>a</i>. Deferring what has to be said of Sensibility till
the next chapter, we may here touch on its relation to
Irritability, which is often used as its synonym. <i>Objectively</i>
it cannot be distinguished from Irritability, nor
indeed from the most general phenomenon of reaction
under stimulation; in this it is an universal property.
But <i>subjectively</i> it is distinguishable as a peculiar mode
of reaction, only known in nerve-tissues. While all tissues
are irritable, and react on being stimulated, each tissue
has its special mode of reaction. The secreting-cell
reacts differently from the muscle-cell. The reaction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the nerve is the innervation of a centre or a muscle;
the reaction of an innervated centre is sensation; of a
muscle, contraction. There are three aspects of neural
reaction: excitation, propagation of the disturbance, and
innervation. The first is expressed by irritability, the
second by conductibility, the third by sensibility; but
these are only artificial distinctions in the general phenomenon
of transmitted excitation. The nerve substance
is specially distinguished by its instability of molecular
equilibrium; it undergoes chemical change with a readiness
comparable to that of explosive substances. Hence
its facility of propagation of disturbance. There is irritability
and propagation of disturbance in muscular tissue,
notably evident in the continuous tissue of the heart,
intestines, and ureter; but the propagation is slow and
diffusive; whereas in the nerve it is rapid, and restricted
along a definite path. By this rapidity and restriction
the force of the impact is increased; and thus a slight
stimulus applied to the nerve is capable of disturbing the
state of the muscle.</p>

<p>49. Thus while molecular movement is a fundamental
condition of Vitality, and is incessant throughout organized
substance, the massive movements of the organism,
and the movements of particular parts, are the <i>directed
quantities</i> of this molecular agitation. They are due to
stimulation. We distinguish this from mechanical impulsion.
It is a vital process involving molecular change;
it is not simply the <i>communication</i> of motion from without,
but the <i>excitation</i> of motion within. It is not like
the blow which merely displaces an object, but like the
blow which disturbs its molecular equilibrium. The effect,
therefore, depends on this molecular condition: the
blow which scatters a heap of gunpowder will explode a
fulminating salt, and this, in exploding, will excite the
gunpowder to explode. The stimulus which is too feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
to excite contraction in a muscle will be powerful enough
to excite the neurility of a nerve, and <i>that</i> will excite the
contractility of the muscle. The nerve-force is simply
neural stimulus. It acts upon the other tissues as the
nitrogenous salt upon the gunpowder.</p>

<p>Although it is now common to speak of nerves as transmitting
waves of molecular motion, and to regard nerves
as the passive medium for the “transference of force,”
whereby the force is thus made an abstract entity, we
must always remember that such phrases are metaphors,
and that the truer expression will be not “transference of
force,” but the “propagation of excitation.” I mean that
it is not the <i>force</i> of the impact nor its <i>energy</i> which a
nerve transmits, it is the vibratory change produced in the
nerve by the impact, which excites another change in the
organ to which the nerve goes. We know by accurate
measurements that the excitation of a nerve lasts much
longer than the <i>stimulus</i>, a momentary impact producing
an enduring agitation. We know also that the excitation
of a centre lasts longer than the muscular contraction it
has initiated. We know, moreover, that a nerve may be
totally incapable of conducting an external stimulus, yet
quite capable of conducting a central stimulus; were it
a passive conductor like a wire this would not be so.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>50. The nerve is essentially an exciter of change, and
thereby a regulator. A muscle in action does not appreciably
determine action in any other (except in the comparatively
rare cases of anastomosing muscles); a secreting
cell does not propagate its excitation to others. The
nerve, on the contrary, not only propagates its excitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
and awakens the activity of the muscle or gland with
which it is connected, but through the centre affects the
whole <span class="locked">organism—</span></p>

</div>

<p class="in0">Thus it is that stimulation which in the simpler organisms
was diffused throughout the protoplasm, has in the
complex organisms become the specialized property of a
particular tissue.</p>

<p>51. Two general facts of supreme importance must
now be stated: One is the law of stimulation—<i>every
excitation pursues the path of least resistance</i>. The second
is the condition of stimulation—<i>unlike mechanical impulsion,
it acts only at insensible distances</i>.</p>

<p>52. This means that although a nerve may be excited
by any stimulus external to it which changes its molecular
condition, no propagation of that change (i. e. no stimulation
through the nerve) is possible except through continuity
of substance. Mere physical contact suffices to
excite the nerve; but if there be an interruption of continuity
in the nerve itself, no stimulus-wave passes across
that line. Cut a nerve, and bring the divided surfaces
once more into close contact, there will still be such a
solution of continuity as to arrest the stimulus-wave,
mere physical contact not sufficing for the propagation.
Whereas across the cut ends of a divided nerve, even
visibly separated, the electric current easily passes. This
necessity for the vital continuity of tissue in the propagation
of stimulation must always be borne in mind. The
presence of a membrane, however delicate, or of any tissue
having a different molecular constitution, suffices to arrest
or divert the wave. I conceive, therefore, that it is absolutely
indispensable that a nerve should terminate in and
<i>blend</i> with a muscle or a centre, otherwise no stimulation
of muscle or centre will take place through the nerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<div id="ifig_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_200.jpg" width="381" height="434" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 13.</div></div>

<p>53. The difference between excitation from contact and
stimulation from continuity may be thus illustrated. In
<a href="#ifig_13">Fig. 13</a> we see the legs of a frog attached to the spine by
the lumbar nerves (<i>l</i>), and lying on the muscles (<i>m</i>) of
one leg is the nerve (<i>c</i>) of another frog’s leg. Applying
the electrodes to (<i>l</i>), the muscles (<i>m</i>) are violently contracted;
not only so, but their contraction excites the
other nerve (<i>c</i>), and the leg attached to this nerve is
thereby thrown into contraction. This “secondary contraction,”
as Dubois Reymond calls it, might be supposed
to be due to a diffusion of the electrical current; but that
it is due to a change in the muscles (<i>m</i>) is proved by delicate
experiments showing that the movements in the
detached leg are of precisely the same kind as those in
the legs directly stimulated. If there is only a muscular
shock in the one case, there is only a muscular shock in
the other; if there is tetanus in the one, there is tetanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
in the other; if the muscles of the first leg are fatigued
and respond slowly and feebly, the response of the second
is slow and feeble. Moreover, the secondary contraction
may be produced by chemical or mechanical stimulus, as
well as by the electrical.</p>

<p>54. Although the contraction of a muscle is thus seen
to be capable of exciting a nerve in contact with it, the
reverse is not true: we can produce no contraction in
a muscle by exciting a nerve simply in contact with
the muscle, and not penetrating its tissue and terminating
there. Accordingly we always find a nerve when
about to enter a muscle or a centre losing its <i>protecting</i>
envelopes; it gradually becomes identified as a protoplasmic
thread with the protoplasm of the muscle or the
centre.</p>

<p>55. Neurility, then, is the propagation of molecular
change. Two offices are subserved by the nervous system,
which may respectively be called Excitation—the
disturbance of molecular <i>tension</i> in tissues, and consequent
liberation of their energies; and Co-ordination—the
direction of these several energies into combined
actions. Thus, when the muscle is in a given state of
molecular tension, the stimulation of its nerve will change
that state, causing it to contract if it be in repose. But
this stimulation, which will thus cause a contraction, will
be arrested, if at the same time a more powerful stimulation
reaches the antagonist muscle, or some distant centre:
then the muscle only <i>tends</i> to contract.</p>

<h3 id="sec_14">ORIGIN OF NERVE-FORCE.</h3>

<p>56. After this brief account of Neurility we may pass
to the consideration of its origin. Are we to understand
that this property belongs to the nerves themselves in the
sense in which Contractility belongs to the muscles? or
are we to accept the teaching which assigns the origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
“nerve-force” to the ganglia, and regards the nerves simply
as passive conductors of a force developed in the
cells?</p>

<p>57. It is now many years since I ventured to criticise
the reigning doctrine, and to urge the necessity Of consistently
carrying out the distinction between Property and
Function. I called attention to the positive evidence
which contradicted the idea of passive conduction; and
pointed out the illusory nature of the favorite analogy, in
which ganglia were likened to batteries, and nerves to
the conducting wires. But the old image still exerts its
empire; and writers are still found speaking of the brain
as a telegraphic bureau, the ganglia as stations, and the
nerves as wires. In the cells of the gray substance they
place a constantly renewing reservoir of nerve-force.
There the force is elaborated, stored up, and from thence
directed along the nerves. The sensory nerve “transmits
an impression to the brain”—as the wire transmits a
message to the bureau. The motor nerve, in turn,
“transmits the mandates of the will”—and all is clear!
Clear, until we come to translate metaphors into visible
facts, or try to conjure up some mental image of the
process. For myself, I can only conceive nerve-force as
the activity of the nerve, and not of something <i>else</i>. This
becomes still more evident when I find that the activity
is equally manifest after its imaginary source has been
removed. Transmitting impressions, or messages, implies
as a preliminary that there should be an impressible
agent, or a <i>message-sender</i>, at the periphery. No one supposes
that simply touching one end of a wire would send
an “impression” or a “message” to the battery; or that
without the battery this touch would evolve a current.
The battery is indispensable; in <i>it</i> is evolved the current
which the wire transmits. Not so the ganglion, or brain.
Remove the wire from its connection with the battery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and it is a bit of wire, nothing more. But remove a
nerve from its connection with a ganglion, and it is still
active as nerve, still displays its Neurility when excited,
still moves the muscle as before. The amputated limb
will move when its nerves are stimulated, just as when
a reflex from its centre moved it. Every one knew the
fact; it was staring them in the face, yet they disregarded
it. Even the old anatomist, Willis, had recorded experiments
which ought to have opened their eyes. He tied
the phrenic nerve, and found that, when he irritated it
below the ligature, the diaphragm moved; but when he
irritated it above the ligature, no movement followed.
Since his days, thousands of experiments have shown that
the presence of a ganglion is not necessary to the action
of a nerve.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>58. Of course an explanation was ready. The nerve
was said to have been “endowed with force” from its
ganglion during their vital connection; and this force,
stored up in the nerve, was disposable for some time after
separation from the ganglion. We need not pause to
criticise this misty conception of one part “endowing”
another with force; the plain facts afford the best answer.
There seemed, indeed, a confirmation of the hypothesis in
the fact that although the nerve separated from its ganglion
was capable of excitation, yet after a few excitations
it was exhausted, and ceased to stimulate the muscle. It
seemed like the piece of magnetized iron which would act
as a temporary magnet, though quickly losing this borrowed
power. But the whole fabric fell—or ought to
have fallen—when extended observation discovered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
this exhausted nerve would, if left in repose, <i>recover</i> its
lost power. A nerve preserves its excitability as long as
it preserves its structural integrity, and recovers its power
in recovering that integrity. The length of time varies.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
Gratiolet found the muscles in the leg of a tortoise, which
had been amputated a week before, contract when the
nerves were irritated; and Schiff found the divided nerve
of a winter frog excitable at the end of three weeks.
Even after all excitability has disappeared, it will reappear
if arterial blood be injected; just as muscles which
have already begun to assume cadaveric rigidity recover
their contractility after transfusion. Nor is this all. The
separated nerve finally degenerates, and loses all its structural
characters and physiological properties; yet under
favorable conditions it will regenerate—recover its structures
and properties; and this even apart from a centre,
as Vulpian showed. Very noticeable is the fact that the
force said to be produced in the centre, and only “conveyed”
by the nerve, vanishes gradually from the centre
to the periphery, and recovers from the periphery to the
centre—the part of the nerve which is farthest from the
centre being excitable when the part nearest the centre is
still inexcitable. Again, when a nerve is pinched, contraction
in the muscle follows; but the pinch has for a
time so disturbed the structural integrity of the nerve (at
that spot) that no irritant applied to the spot, or <i>between</i>
it and the centre, will be followed by contraction, whereas
<i>below</i> the spot an irritation takes effect. This is another
form of the experiment of Willis. Even in its normal
state, the nerve has different degrees of excitability in
different parts of its course,—a fact discovered by
Pflüger which is quite irreconcilable with the hypothesis
of passive conduction. Doubts have been thrown on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Pflüger’s interpretation,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> namely, that there is an avalanche-like
accumulation of energy proportionate to the
length of the stimulated portion; but the fact remains,
that one and the same irritant applied successively to two
different points of a nerve does not irritate the muscle in
the same degree. Munk also finds the velocity of transmission
in a motor nerve increases as it approaches its
termination in the muscle.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>59. Nothing can be more unlike the conduction of an
electric current than this excitation of Neurility; nothing
more accordant with the idea of it as a vital property of
the tissue. The notion of its being derived from a centre
is on a par with the notion first successfully combated by
Haller,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> that the muscle derived its Contractility from
the nerves; or the analogous notion that the electric
organ in fishes derived its property from the brain. Indeed,
it was in support of the hypothesis that the brain
was a battery, and nerves the conductors, that the phenomena
observed in electrical fishes were frequently cited.
The electric organ was seen to be connected with the
brain; its discharges were under the control of the animal,
and were destroyed on one side when the brain on
the corresponding side was destroyed. But Charles Robin
long ago suggested, what indeed ought never to have been
doubted, that the brain was not the source of the electricity;
but that the tissue of the electric organ itself had
this special property, which the nerve merely called into
activity. The suggestion has been experimentally verified
by M. Moreau, who divided all the nerves supplying
the electric organ on one side, and, having thus cut off all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
communication with the brain, produced electrical discharges
by irritating the nerves; precisely as the muscles
are made to contract when the divided nerves are irritated.
Had the experiment ceased here, it might have
been interpreted on the old hypothesis: the electric
organ might be supposed to have a certain amount of
electric force condensed in it, stored up there, as it is said
to be in the nerves, and discharged when the organ is irritated.
But experiment has decided this point also. Electric
fishes notoriously exhaust their power by a few discharges,
and recover it after repose. When M. Moreau
had exhausted his mutilated fishes, he replaced them in
the water, and allowed them repose. On again irritating
the divided nerves, the discharges were again produced.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>60. On all sides the idea of nerves deriving their power
from another source than their own substance is seen to
be untenable. <i>A priori</i> this might have been concluded.
Neurility is the vital property of nerve-tissue. “Nerve-force”
is nerve-action—molecular changes in the nerve
itself, not in some remote substance. That nerve and
centre are vitally connected is true; and what their physiological
relations are will hereafter be examined; but
we must dismiss the idea of nerves having the relation to
centres that electrodes have to batteries.</p>

<p>61. In proposing the term Neurility, I not only wished
to get rid of the ambiguities which hovered round “nerve-force”
and “nerve-current,” but to recall the physiological
principle that properties are dependent on structures;
and therefore that the special property of nerve-tissue is
conditioned by its structure. Neurility is, of course, an
abstraction; but so is <i>the</i> nerve an abstraction. The concrete
manifestations are the several nerve-actions. These
we classify and specify. One class we call sensory,
another class motor; not because the nerve-action itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
is different, but because it is in each class in a different
functional relation to other parts. In classing men as
governors and governed, employers and employed, we do
not suppose anthropological distinctions, but only differences
in their social functions.</p>

<p>62. This is the modification of the Law of Bell to
which reference was made in § <a href="#II_26">26</a>. It replaces the idea
of two different kinds of nerve, sensory and motor, by
that of two different anatomical connections. I need not
reproduce here the argument with which I formerly criticised
the supposed distinction between sensory and motor
nerves; because the old idea is rapidly falling into discredit,
and physiologists so eminent as Vulpian and
Wundt have explicitly announced their adhesion to the
principle of identity,—a principle which, as Vulpian truly
remarks, dominates the whole physiology of the nervous
system.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_15">THE HYPOTHESIS OF SPECIFIC ENERGIES.</h3>

<p id="II_63">63. One development of the theory of Bell, respecting
the different kinds of nerve, has been the still accredited
hypothesis that each nerve has a “specific energy,” or quality,
in virtue of which it acts and reacts only in one way.
The optic nerve, no matter how stimulated, only responds
by a sensation of color, the auditory nerve only by a sensation
of sound; and so on. This hypothesis, which (as I
learn from a correspondent)<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> was originally propounded
by Bell himself, was developed and made an European
doctrine by Johannes Müller, first in his remarkable treatise,
<i>Über die phantastischen Gesichtserscheinungen</i> (1826),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and afterwards in his <i>Physiology</i>. Like all good hypotheses,
it has been fruitful; and Helmholtz still holds it to
be of extraordinary importance for the theory of perception.
Although combated by a few physiologists, it has
kept its place firm in the general acceptance; no doubt
because it forms a ready explanation of the facts. But, as
I often have to remark, <i>explanation</i> is not <i>demonstration</i>.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>64. The first criticism to be made on the hypothesis is
that it commits the error of confounding function with
property, assigning as a specific quality of the nerve the
reaction of the organ innervated. Thus Müller speaks of
the specific energy as “the essential condition of the
nerves in virtue of which they see light and hear sound.”
But the optic nerve no more <i>sees</i>, than the liver-nerve
<i>secretes</i> bile. That the optic nerve is one element in the
mechanism on which vision depends, is all that we can
say, Müller declares that it is not sufficient to assume
each nerve to be so constituted that it has a susceptibility
to certain stimuli rather than to others; but that “with
Aristotle we must ascribe to each a peculiar energy as its
vital quality. Sensation,” he adds, “consists in the sensorium
receiving through the medium of the nerves a
<i>knowledge of certain qualities</i>,—a condition, not of the
external bodies, but of the nerves themselves,”—and
these qualities are different in different nerves. In other
words, he assumes a special substance for each special
energy. The sensation of color depends on the special
Visual substance (<i>Sehsinnsubstanz</i>); the sensation
of sound on the Auditory substance (<i>Hörsinnsubstanz</i>);
and so on.</p>

<p>65. We have here an hypothesis analogous to that of
Innate Ideas, or <i>a priori</i> Forms of Thought. It is, in fact,
only a reproduction of that conception carried into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
sphere of Sense. No one thinks of assigning specific
energies to the several muscles, yet a movement of prehension
is as different from a movement of extension, a
peristaltic movement is as different from a movement
of occlusion, as a sensation of sound is from a sensation of
color. If movement is common to both of the one class,
feeling is common to both of the other: the forms and
mechanism are different and specific. Muscles have the
common property of contracting under stimulation; whatever
be the nature of the stimulus, each muscle has its
own particular response, or mode of reaction: the flexor
always bending, never extending the limb; the sphincter
always closing, never opening the orifice. The movements
of the heart are not the same as those of the eye;
both are unlike the movements of the intestine. There
are muscles which respond to some stimuli, and not to
others. Those of the eye, or of the vocal chords, respond
to impulses which would leave the masseter or biceps
unstirred. According to Marey, the hyoglossus of a frog
will become tetanic under a stimulus of only ten pulses in
a second; whereas the gastrocnemius of that same frog
resists a stimulus of less than twenty in a second. We
find the retina responding to ethereal pulses which leave
the auditorius unaffected; we find the muscles of a gnat’s
wing so exquisitely susceptible that the wing beats eight
thousand times in a second,—a delicacy in comparison
with which even our muscles of the eye are coarse.</p>

<p>66. The facts which the hypothesis of specific energies
is called on to explain are more consistently interpreted
on the admission of a common property in nerve-tissue,
manifesting different degrees of excitability, and entering
into different mechanisms, so that the functional results
differ. A nerve which may be stimulated from the skin
will not respond at all, or not in the same way, if the
stimulus be applied under the skin. Are we to suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
that the specific energy resides in one part of the nerve,
and not in another?<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> That the optic nerve responds to
stimuli which will not sensibly excite a motor nerve,
depends on the terminal structures through which the
stimulation is excited; for the optic nerve itself, apart
from the retinal expansion, is as insensible to light as the
motor nerve is. And the specific sensation, or movement,
which <i>results</i> from stimulation of a nerve depends not on
the nerve, but on the mechanism of which the nerve is
one element. Sensations of touch, temperature, and pain
are assuredly specific; they are as unlike each other as
a sensation of taste is unlike a sensation of smell. Yet
the same nerves, variously stimulated, produce all three
sensations.</p>

<p>67. We conclude, therefore, that the phrase “specific
energy” is an elliptical expression for the particular office
of a nerve. In this meaning there is no obscurity. The
optic nerve is not a vasomotor nerve, the skin nerve is
not a muscle nerve; the auditory nerve is a nerve of
special sensation, the vagus is a nerve of systemic sensation;
and so on. Neither movement nor sensation belongs
to the nerves themselves.</p>

<span class="subhead">SENSIBILITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>68. <span class="firstword">The</span> principles laid down in the preceding chapter
are equally applicable to the central system. But here
greater difficulties await us. We cannot expect traditional
views to be easily displaced, when they have
taken such hold on the mind, as is the case with regard
to Sensibility. To admit that all nerves have a common
property, and that their functional relations depend on
the organs which they innervate, demands small relinquishment
of cherished opinions. But to admit that
all nerve-centres have a common property, and that their
functional relations depend on their anatomical connections,
is to sweep away at once a mass of theoretic interpretations
which from long familiarity have acquired
an almost axiomatic force. That the brain, and the brain
only, is the source and seat of Sensibility is the postulate
of modern Physiology.</p>

<p>69. The question is one of extreme complexity, but
may be greatly simplified, if we can manage to reduce it
to purely physiological terms, and consider the phenomena
in their objective aspect. In dealing with nerves and
their actions this was comparatively easy; we had for
the most part only physiological processes to unravel.
It is otherwise in dealing with nerve-centres—the subjective
or psychological aspect of the phenomena inevitably
thrusts itself on our attention; and all the mysteries
of Feeling and Thought cloud our vision of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
neural process. Do what we will, we cannot altogether
divest Sensibility of its psychological connotations, cannot
help interpreting it in terms of Consciousness; so
that even when treating of sensitive phenomena observed
in molluscs and insects, we always imagine these
more or less suffused with Feeling, as this is known in
our own conscious states.</p>

<p>70. Feeling is recognized as in some way or other
bound up with neural processes; but Physiology proper
has only to concern itself with the processes; and the
question whether these can, and do, go on unaccompanied
by Feeling, is, strictly speaking, one which belongs
to Psychology. It demands as a preliminary that the
term Feeling be defined; and the answer will depend
upon that definition, namely, whether Feeling be interpreted
as synonymous with Consciousness in the restricted
sense, or synonymous with the more general term
Sentience. If the former, then since there are unquestionably
neural processes of which we are not conscious,
we must specify the particular groups which subserve
Feeling; as we specify the particular groups which subserve
the sensations of Sight, Hearing, Taste, etc.; and
localize the separate functions in separate organs. If the
latter, then, since all neural processes have a common
character, we have only to localize the particular variations
of its manifestation, and distinguish sensitive phenomena
as we distinguish motor phenomena.</p>

<p>71. It is absolutely certain that the Feeling we attribute
to a mollusc is different from that which we attribute
to a man; if only because the organisms of the two
are so widely different, and have been under such different
conditions of excitation. If every feeling is the functional
result of special organic activities, varying with
the co-operant elements, we can have no more warrant
for assuming the existence of the same <i>particular</i> forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of Feeling in organisms that are unlike, than for assuming
the 47th proposition of Euclid to be presented by any
three straight lines. The lines are the necessary basis
for the construction, but they are not the triangle, except
when in a special configuration. This is not denying
that animals <i>feel</i> (in the general sense of that term),
it is only asserting that their feelings must be very <i>unlike</i>
our own. Even in our own race we see marked differences—some
modes of feeling being absolutely denied
to individuals only slightly differing from their fellows.
If, however, we admit that different animals must have
different modes of Feeling, we must also admit that the
neuro-muscular activities are generically alike in all,
because of the fundamental similarity in the structures.
Whether we shall assign Feeling to the mollusc or not
will depend on the meaning of the term; but, at all
events, we require some term general enough to include
the phenomena manifested by the mollusc, and those
manifested by all other animals. Sensibility is the least
objectionable term. Unless we adopt some such general
designation, physiological and psychological interpretations
become contradictory and obscure. The current
doctrine which assigns Sensibility to the brain, denying
it to all other centres, is seriously defective, inasmuch
as it implies that tissues similar in kind have utterly
diverse properties; in other words, that the same nerve-tissue
which manifests Sensibility in the brain has no
such property in the spinal cord.</p>

<p>72. How is this tenable? No one acquainted at first
hand with the facts denies that the objective phenomena
exhibited by the brainless animal have the same general
character as those of the animal possessing a brain: the
actions of the two are identical in all cases which admit
of comparison. That is to say, the objective appearances
are the same; differing only in so far as the mechanisms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
are made different by the presence or absence of certain
parts. The brain not being a necessary part of the mechanical
adjustments in swimming, or pushing aside an
irritating object, the brainless frog swims and defends itself
in the same way as the normal frog. But no sooner
do we pass from the objective interpretation, and introduce
the subjective element of Feeling among the series
of factors necessary to the product—no sooner do we ask
whether the brainless frog <i>feels</i> the irritation against
which it struggles, or <i>wills</i> the movements by which it
swims—than the question has shifted its ground, and has
passed from Physiology to Psychology. The appeal is no
longer made to Observation, but to Interpretation. Observation
tells us here nothing directly of Feeling. What
it does tell us, however, is the identity of the objective
phenomena; and Physiology demands that a common
term be employed to designate the character common to
the varied phenomena. Sensibility is such a term. But
most modern physiologists, under the bias of tradition,
refuse to extend Sensibility to the spinal cord, in spite
of the evidences of the spinal cord possessing that property
in common with the brain. They prefer to invoke
a new property; they assign spinal action to a Reflex
Mechanism which has nothing of the character of Sensibility,
because they have identified Sensibility with
Consciousness, and have restricted Consciousness to a
special group of sensitive phenomena.</p>

<p>73. Nor is it to be denied that on this ground they
have a firm basis. Every one could testify to the fact
that many processes normally go on without being accompanied
by consciousness, in the special meaning of the
term. Reflex actions,—such as winking, breathing, swallowing,—notoriously
produced by stimulation of sensitive
surfaces, take place without our “feeling” them, or
being “conscious” of them. Hence it is concluded that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the Reflex mechanism suffices without the intervention of
Sensibility. I altogether dispute the conclusion; and in
a future Problem will endeavor to show that Sensibility
is necessary to Reflex Action. But without awaiting that
exposition we may at once confront the evidence, by adducing
the familiar fact that “unconscious” processes go
on in the brain as well as in the spinal cord; and this not
simply in the sphere of Volition, but also in the sphere of
Thought.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> We act and think “automatically” at times,
and are quite “unconscious” of what we are doing, or
of the data we are logically grouping. We often think
as unconsciously as we breathe; although from time to
time we become conscious of both processes. Yet who
will assert that these unconscious processes were independent
of Sensibility? Who will maintain that because
cerebral processes are sometimes unaccompanied by that
peculiar state named Consciousness, therefore all its processes
are unaccompanied by Feeling? And if here we
admit that the Reflex mechanism in the brain is a <i>sensitive</i>
mechanism, surely we must equally admit that the similar
Reflex mechanism in the spinal cord is sensitive?</p>

<p>74. Let it be understood that Sensibility is the common
property of nerve-centres, and physiological interpretations
will become clear and consistent. Consciousness,
as understood by psychologists, is not a property of
tissue, it is a function of the organism, dependent indeed
on Sensibility, but not convertible with it. There is a
greater distinction between the two than between Sensation,
the reaction of a sensory organ, and Perception, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
combined result of sensory and cerebral reactions; or
than that between Contractility, the property of the muscles,
and Flying, the function of a particular group of
muscles. It is not possible to have Consciousness without
Sensibility; but perfectly possible to have Sensations
without Consciousness. This will perhaps seem as inconceivable
to the reader as it seemed to Schröder van der
Kolk.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>75. Let us illustrate it by the analogy of Pain. There
is a vast amount of sensation normally excited which is
totally unaccompanied by the feelings classed as painful.
The action of the special senses may be exaggerated to an
intolerable degree, but the exaggeration never passes into
pain: the retina may be blinded with excess of light, and
the ear stunned with sound—the optic nerve may be
pricked or cut—but no pain results. The systemic sensations
also are habitually painless, though they pass into
pain in abnormal states. Clearly, then, Pain is not the
necessary consequence of Sensibility; and this is true not
only of certain sensitive parts, but of all; as is proved in
the well-known facts of Analgesia, in which complete
insensibility of the skin as regards Pain co-exists with
vivid sensibility as regards Touch and Temperature.
Hence the majority of physiologists refuse to acknowledge
that the struggles and cries of an animal, after
removal of the brain, are evidences of pain; maintaining
that they are “simply reflex actions.” This is probable;
the more so as we know the struggles and cries which
tickling will produce, yet no pain accompanies tickling.
But if the struggles and cries are not evidence of pain,
they are surely evidence of Sensibility.</p>

<p>76. Now for the term Pain in the foregoing paragraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
substitute the term Consciousness, and you will perhaps
allow that while it may be justifiable to interpret the
actions of a brainless animal as due to a mechanism
which is unaccompanied by the <i>specially conditioned forms</i>
of Sensibility classed under Consciousness—just as it
is unaccompanied by the specially conditioned forms of
Perception and Emotion—there is no justification for
assuming the mechanism not to have been a <i>sensitive</i>
mechanism. The wingless bird cannot manifest any Of
the phenomena of flight; but we do not therefore deny
that its <i>other</i> movements depend on Contractility.</p>

<p>77. Difficult as it must be to keep the physiological
question apart from the psychological when treating of
Sensibility, we shall never succeed in our analysis unless
the two questions are separately treated. The physiologist
considers organisms and their actions from their
objective side, and tries to detect the mechanism of the
observed phenomena. These he has to interpret in terms
of Matter and Motion. The psychologist interprets them
in terms of Feeling. The actions which we <i>see</i> in others
we cannot <i>feel</i>, except as visual sensations; the changes
which we feel in ourselves we cannot see in others, except
as bodily movements. The reaction of a sensory organ
is by the physiologist called a sensation,—borrowing the
term from the psychologist; he explains it as due to the
stimulus which changes the molecular condition of the
organ; and this changed condition, besides being seen to
be followed by a muscular movement, is <i>inferred</i> to be
accompanied by a change of Feeling. The psychologist
has direct knowledge only of the change of Feeling which
follows on some other change; he infers that it is originated
by the action of some external cause, and infers that
a neural process precedes, or accompanies, the feeling.
Obviously there are two distinct questions here, involving
distinct methods. The physiologist is compelled to complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
his objective observations by subjective suggestions;
compelled to add Feeling to the terms of Matter and
Motion, in spite of the radical diversity of their aspects.
The psychologist also is compelled to complete his subjective
observations by objective interpretations, linking
the internal changes to the external changes. A complete
theory must harmonize the two procedures.</p>

<p>78. In a subsequent Problem we shall have to examine
the nature of Sensation in its psychological aspect; here
we have first to describe its physiological aspect. To the
psychologist, a sensation is simply a fact of Consciousness;
he has nothing whatever to do with the neural process,
which the physiologist considers to be the physical
basis of this fact; and he therefore regards the physiologists
as talking nonsense when they talk of “unconscious
sensations,” the phrase being to him equivalent to “unfelt
feelings,” or “invisible light.” It is quite otherwise with
the physiologist, who viewing a sensation solely as a neural
process, the reaction of a sensory organ, can lawfully
speak of unconscious sensations, as the physicist can
speak of invisible rays of light,—meaning those rays
which are of a different order of undulation from the visible
rays, and which may become visible when the susceptibility
of the retina is exalted. He knows that there
are different modes, and different complexities of neural
process; to one class he assigns consciousness, to the
other unconsciousness. If he would be severely precise,
he would never speak of sensation at all, but only of sensory
reaction. But such precision would be pedantic
and idle. He wants the connotations of the term sensation,
and therefore uses it.</p>

<p>79. The functional activity of a gland is stimulated by
a neural process reflected from a centre; by a similar
process a muscle is called into action. No one supposes
that the neural process is, in the one case secretory, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
other motory: in both it is the same process in the nerve;
and our investigation of it would be greatly hampered if
we did not disengage it from all the suggestions hovering
around the ideas of secretion and muscular action. In
like manner we must disengage the neural process of a
sensory reaction from all the suggestions hovering around
the idea of Consciousness, when that term designates a
complex of many reactions. In Problem III. we shall
enter more particularly into the distinction between Sensibility
and Consciousness; for the present it must suffice
to say that great ambiguity exists in the current usage
of these terms. Sometimes Consciousness stands as the
equivalent of Sensibility; sometimes as a particular
<i>mode</i> of Sensibility known as Reflection, Attention, and
Thought. The former meaning is an extension of the
term similar to that given to the word Rose, which originally
meaning Red came to be restricted to a particular
red flower; and after other flowers of the same kind were
discovered which had yellow and white petals, instead of
red, the term rose still adhered even to these. “Yellow
Rose” is therefore as great a verbal solecism as unconscious
sensation. We have separated the redness from
the rose, and can then say that the color is one thing, the
flower another. By a similar process of abstraction we
separate Consciousness from Sensation, and we can then
say that there are sensations without consciousness. In
consequence of this, psychologists often maintain that to
have a sensation and be conscious of it are two different
states. We are said to hear a sound, and yet not to be
conscious of hearing it. The sound excites a movement,
but it does not excite our consciousness. Now although
it is true that there are roses which are not red, it is not
true that there are roses which have no color at all. Although
it is true that there are sensations which are not
of the particular mode of Sensibility which psychologists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
specially designate as Consciousness, it is not true that
there are sensations which are not modes of Sensibility.</p>

<p>80. And what is Sensibility which, on its subjective
side, is Sentience? In one sense it may be answered
that we do not know. In another sense it is that which
we know most clearly and positively: Sentience forms the
substance of all knowledge. Being the ultimate of knowledge,
every effort must be vain which attempts to explain
it by reduction to simpler elements. The human mind,
impatient of ultimates, is always striving to pierce beyond
the fundamental mysteries; and this impatience leads to
the attempts so often made to explain Sensibility by reducing
it to terms of Matter and Motion. But inasmuch
as a clear analysis of Matter and Motion displays that our
knowledge of these is simply a knowledge of modes of
Feeling, the reduction of Sentience or Sensibility to Matter
and Motion is simply the reduction of Sensibility to
some of its modes. This point gained, a clear conception
of the advantages of introducing the ideas of Matter and
Motion will result. It will then be the familiar and indispensable
method of explaining the little known by the
better known. The objective aspect of things is commonly
represented in the visible and palpable; because
what we can see we can also generally touch, and what
we can touch we can taste and smell; but we cannot
touch an odor nor a sound; we cannot see them; we can
only connect the odorous and sonorous objects with visible
or palpable conditions. Everywhere we find sensations
referred to visible or palpable causes; and hence the
desire to find this objective basis for every change in Sensibility.
The sensation, or state of consciousness, is the
ultimate fact; we can only <i>explain</i> it by describing its
objective conditions.</p>

<p id="II_81">81. Thus much on the philosophical side. Returning
to our physiological point, we must say that a sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
is, objectively, the reaction of a sensory organ, or organism;
subjectively, a change of feeling. Objectively it is
a phenomenon of movement, but distinguishable from
other phenomena by the speciality of its conditions. It
is a vital phenomenon, not a purely mechanical phenomenon.
Although the molecular movement conforms, of
course, to mechanical principles, and may be viewed abstractly
as a purely mechanical result, yet, because it
takes place under conditions never found in machines, it
has characters which markedly separate it from the movements
of machines. Among these differential characters
may be cited that of <i>selective adaptation</i>,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> which is most
conspicuous in volition.</p>

<p>82. In the early stages of animal evolution there is
no differentiation into muscle and nerve. The whole
organism is equally sensitive (or irritable) in every part.
Muscles appear, and then they are the most sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
parts. Nerves appear, and the seat of Sensibility has
been transferred to them; not that the muscles have lost
theirs, but their irritability is now represented by their
dominant character of Contractility, and the nerves have
taken on the special office of Sensibility. That is to say,
while both muscle and nerve form integral elements of
the sensitive reaction, the process itself is analytically
conceived as a combination of two distinct properties,
resident in two distinct tissues.</p>

<p>83. Carrying further this analytical artifice, I propose
to distinguish the central organs as the seat of Sensibility,
confining Neurility to the peripheral nerves. In physiological
reality both systems, central and peripheral, are
one; the separation is artificial. Strictly speaking, therefore,
Neurility—or nerve-action—is the general property
of nerve-tissue, central and peripheral. But since
Neurility may be manifested by nerves apart from centres,
whereas Sensibility demands the co-operation of
both, and since we have often to consider the central
process in itself, without attending to the process in the
nerves, it is well to have two characteristic terms. I
shall therefore always use the term Sensibility for the
reactions of the nervous centres,—Sentience being its
psychological equivalent; although the reader will understand
that in point of fact there is no break, nor
transformation, as the wave of change passes from sensory
nerve to centre, and from centre to motor nerve:
there is one continuous process of change. But just as
we analytically distinguish the sensory from the motor
element of this indissoluble process, so we may distinguish
the ingoing and outgoing stages from the combining
stage. Sensibility, then, represents the property of <i>combining</i>
and grouping stimulations.</p>

<p>84. Fully aware of the misleading connotations of the
term, and of the difficulty which will be felt in disengaging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
it from these, especially in reference to Consciousness,
I have long hesitated before adopting it. But the
advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages. Sensibility
has long been admitted to express the peculiar
modes of reaction in plants and animals low down in the
scale. No one hesitates to speak of a sensitive plant, or
a sensitive surface. The tentacles of a polype are said to
be sensitive; though probably no one thereby means that
the polype has what psychologists mean by Consciousness.
By employing the general term Sensibility to designate
the whole range of reactions peculiar to the nerve-centres,
when these special organs exist, it will be possible to interpret
all the physiological and psychological phenomena
observed in animals and men on one uniform method.
The observed variations will then be referable to varieties
in organisms.</p>

<p>85. Suppose, for illustration, an organism like the human
except that it is wholly deficient in Sight, Hearing,
Taste, and Smell. It has no sense but Touch—or the
general reaction under contact with external objects. It
will move on being stimulated, and will combine its
movements differently under different stimulations. It
will feel, and logically combine its feelings. But its
mass of feeling will be made of far simpler elements than
ours; its combinations fewer; and the contents of its
Consciousness so very different from ours that we are
unable to conceive what it will be like; we can only be
sure that it will <i>not</i> be very like our own. This truncated
Organism will have its Sensibility; and we must
assign this property to its central nerve-tissue, as we assign
our own. If now we descend lower, and suppose an
organism with no centres whatever, but which nevertheless
displays evidence of Sensibility—feelings and combinations
of movements—we must then conclude that
the property specialized in a particular tissue of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
highly differentiated organism is here diffused throughout.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the sensations or feelings of these
supposed organisms will have a common character with
the feelings of more highly differentiated organisms, although
the modes of manifestation are so various. If we
recognize a common character in muscular movements
so various as the rhythmic pulsation of the heart, the
larger rhythm of inspiration and expiration, the restless
movements of the eye and tongue, the complexities of
manipulation, the consensus of movements in flying,
swimming, walking, speaking, singing, etc., so may we
recognize a common character in all the varieties of sensation.
The special character of a movement depends
on the moving organ. The special character of a sensation
depends on the sensory organ. Contractility is
the abstract term which expresses all possible varieties
of contraction. Sensibility—or Sentience—is the abstract
term which expresses all possible varieties of sensation.</p>

<p>86. The view here propounded may find a more ready
acceptance when its application to all physiological questions
has been tested, and it is seen to give coherence to
many scattered and hitherto irreconcilable facts. Meanwhile
let a glance be taken at the inconsistencies of the
current doctrine. That doctrine declares one half of the
gray substance of the spinal cord to be capable only of
<i>receiving</i> a sensitive stimulation, the other half capable
only of <i>originating</i> a motor stimulation. We might with
equal propriety declare that one half of a muscle is capable
only of receiving a contractile stimulation, and the
other half of contracting. The ingoing nerve, passing
from the surface to the posterior part of the spinal cord,
excites the activity of the gray substance into which it
penetrates; with the anterior part of this gray substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
an outgoing nerve is connected, and through it the excitation
is propagated to a muscle: contraction results.
Such are the facts. In our analysis we separate the sensory
from the motor aspect, and we then imagine that
this ideal distinction represents a real separation. We
suppose a phenomenon of Sensibility independent of a
phenomenon of Contractility—suppose the one to be
“transformed” into the other—and we then marvel
“how during this passage the excitation changes its
nature.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>87. Before exerting ingenuity in explaining a fact, it
is always well to make sure that the fact itself is correctly
stated. <i>Does</i> the neural excitation change its
nature in passing from the posterior to the anterior gray
substance? I can see no evidence of it. Indeed the
statement seems to confound a neural process with a
muscular process. The neural process is one continuous
excitation along the whole line of ingoing nerve, centre,
and outgoing nerve, which nowhere ceases or changes
into another process, until the excitation of the muscle
introduces a new factor. So long as the excitation keeps
within the nerve-tissue, it is one and the same process
of change; its issue in a contraction, a secretion, or a
change in the conditions of consciousness, depends on
the organs it stimulates.</p>

<p id="II_88">88. I have already called attention to the artificial
nature of all our distinctions, and the necessity of such
artifices. They are products of that</p>

<p class="in0">The distinction of Central and Peripheral systems is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
simply anatomical, it has a physiological justification in
this, that the Central System is the organ of connection.
Any one part of it directly excited by an ingoing nerve
propagates that excitation throughout the whole central
mass, and thus affects every part of the organism. Therefore
we place Sensibility in it.</p>

<p>But this general Property subserves various Functions,
according as the Central System is variously related to
different organs. This fact has given rise to the idea that
different portions of the cerebro-spinal axis have different
properties—which is a serious error. What is certain is
that the Cerebrum must have a different function from
that of the Thalami, and the Cerebellum one different
from the Medulla Oblongata; while that of the Medulla
Spinalis is different from all. Precisely on the same
grounds that a muscle-nerve has a different office from a
skin-nerve, or the pneumogastric from the acoustic. But
all nerves have one Neurility in common; all centres
have one Sensibility in common.</p>

<span class="subhead">ACTION WITHOUT NERVE-CENTRES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>89. <span class="firstword">It</span> has long been one of the unquestioned postulates
of Physiology that no nerve-action can take place
without the intervention of a centre; and as a corollary,
that all movement has its impulse—reflex or volitional—from
a centre.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> The postulate rests on the assumption
that nerves derive their “force” from their centre. This
assumption we have seen to be erroneous. Yet, in consequence
of its acceptance, experimenters have failed to
notice the many examples of nerve-action independent
of centres. Indeed, except Schiff, Goltz, and Engelmann,
I can name no one who has ventured to suggest that
movements may be excited through nerves without the
co-operation of centres;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> nor have even they explicitly
formulated the conclusion to which their observations
point.</p>

<p>It is true that the majority of muscular movements are
determined by a reflex from centres; and that any break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
in the triple process of the ingoing nerve, centre, and
outgoing nerve, prevents such movements. It is true
that the more conspicuous and harmoniously co-ordinated
phenomena belong to this class. But it is also demonstrable
that many nerve-actions <i>may</i>, and some <i>do</i>, take
place by direct stimulation of the nerve, or direct stimulation
of the muscle, without the intervention of a centre,
without even the intervention of a ganglion. This must
obviously be the case in animals which have no centres;
and even in some which have well-developed nervous
centres, there is every reason to believe that these centres
often act rather in the way of co-ordinating than of
directly stimulating actions.</p>

<p>90. I was first led to doubt the reigning doctrine by a
surprising observation (frequently repeated) after I had
removed the whole nervous centres from a garden snail
(<i>Helix pomatia</i>). The muscular mass called “the foot”
was thrown into slow but energetic contraction whenever
the skin was pricked with the point of a scalpel, or touched
with acid; nay, even when a glass rod dipped in the acid
was brought close to, without absolutely touching, the
skin, the foot curled up, and then slowly relaxed. The
same effect was produced on the “mantle”—where there
was of course no centre. But direct irritation of the muscles
under the skin produced no such contraction; only
through the skin could the stimulation take effect. In
one case I observed this strange phenomenon five hours
after removal of the centres. It was a great puzzle. At
first I concluded that there must be minute ganglia in
the skin, serving as reflex-centres. I searched for them
in vain; and although a longer search on better methods
might <i>possibly</i> have detected ganglionic cells, I soon relinquished
the search, because I had other grounds for
believing that even the presence of abundant ganglia
would not suffice, until some better proof were afforded
that such ganglia were reflex-centres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
91. That direct stimulation of the nerve suffices to
move the muscles, is familiar to all experimenters. There
is no centre, or ganglion, in the amputated leg of the frog,
which nevertheless contracts whenever the sciatic nerve
is stimulated. And after the nerve has been exhausted,
and refuses to respond to any stimulus, the muscle itself
may be directly stimulated. Inasmuch as the movement
depends on the contractility of the muscles, a stimulation
through centre, through motor-nerve, or through muscle,
will be followed by contraction. Let us take a clear case
of reflex action. The pupil of the eye contracts when a
beam of light falls on it, and dilates when the beam is
shut off. The path of the neural process is normally this:
the light stimulates the optic nerve, which in turn stimulates
the corpora quadrigemina; (here the nerves which
move the eye are experimentally proved to be stimulated;)
and it is through these that the pupil is caused to contract.
If the optic nerve be divided, no such reflex takes
place—proving that the contraction does not, at least
normally, come from the ciliary ganglion.</p>

<p>But now it is matter of observation that the pupil will
contract and dilate under the stimuli of light and darkness,
when there is no such reflex pathway open. Removal
of the eye from the body obliterates this path, cuts
the eye off from all connection with the centre. Brown
Séquard removed both eyes from a frog, placed one in a
dark box, and left the other exposed to the light: the
pupil of the former was found dilated, that of the latter
contracted. On reversing the experiment, and placing
the eye with contracted pupil in the dark box, he found it
there dilate, while the dilated pupil exposed to the light
contracted.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> In frogs with very irritable tissues, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
found not only the pupil contracting, after the whole
cranial cavity has been emptied, but even the eyelid
close, on irritating the conjunctiva<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>—yet this is one
of the typical reflex actions! I am disposed to think
that even the action of swallowing may be faintly excited
by stimulation of the pharynx of a brainless frog; but I
have not observations sufficiently precise to enable me to
speak confidently. Goltz has, however, shown that after
removal of brain and spinal cord and heart, there is spontaneous
and active movement in œsophagus and stomach.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
This will no doubt be referred to the agency of
the ganglionic plexus; but similar movements have been
observed by Engelmann in the ureter, and in isolated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
fragments of the ureter in which not a ganglionic cell
was present.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>92. That nerves are stimulated by internal changes
has long been recognized with reference to “subjective
sensations.” The divided nerve, in that portion which
remains connected with the centre, will at times cause
great pain. Obscure organic conditions, changes of temperature,
states of the blood, excite the nerves, and the
patient feels as if the surface of the amputated limb were
irritated. It is all very well to call these “subjective
sensations”; that does not alter the fact of the nerve
being called into activity by other than the normal stimuli
from the surface; in like manner muscular movements
(which are not to be explained as “subjective
movements”) will be excited by organic stimuli when
motor-nerves are separated from their centres. In each
case it has sufficed that the nerve should be excited; and
when excited, no matter by what means, the effect is
always similar.</p>

<p>93. Here are a few facts. Stimulation of the nerves
which send filaments to the chromatophores of the skin
in reptiles causes the skin to become paler, and even
colorless: the color-specks disappear under this contractile
stimulus. This being known, Goltz deprived a frog
of brain, spinal cord, and heart, thus eliminating all possible
influence from them, slit up the skin of the back, and
displayed the nerves which pass from each side of the
spine to the skin; these nerves he then divided on the
right side, and observed the skin on this side slowly
become paler and paler, till finally it was as yellow as
wax; the left side, having its nerves intact, retained its
color. Two conclusions seemed to him warranted by this
experiment: First, that even in the dead frog the nerves
separated from their centre were still active; secondly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
that the irritation of the nerves resulting from their section
was the cause of the color-specks disappearing. This
second conclusion was strengthened when he found that
the irritation was increased when he cut the nerves bit by
bit.</p>

<p>It is not at present, I believe, clearly made out that the
color-specks of the Cephalopoda are in direct connection
with nerves; but it is tolerably certain that they are in
some way under the influence of nervous stimulation,
directly or indirectly. D’Orbigny, indeed, goes so far as
to say they are dependent on the will of the animal.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
This seems very lax language; but restricting ourselves
to the fact of nervous influence, the experiments of Goltz
receive further illustration in an observation I have elsewhere
recorded.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> I found that a strip of skin taken
from the dead body of a calamary (<i>Loligo</i>) showed the
color-specks expanding and contracting with vigor.</p>

<p>94. The heart is well known to beat after death, if
death be not the result of a gradual decay. Sometimes,
indeed, its muscular irritability is so active that the heart
will beat for hours. E. Rousseau observed it beating in
a woman twenty-seven hours after she had been guillotined.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
Not only will it beat after death, but in many
animals even after removal from the body: the heart of a
young puppy, or kitten, will beat for three or four hours
after its removal; that of a full-grown dog, or cat, not one
hour; whereas the beating of that of a tortoise, or a frog,
will, under proper precautions, be preserved for days—and
even after it has stopped, it may be stimulated to
fresh pulsations.</p>

<p>Physiologists explain this spontaneous movement of
the heart as due to the ganglia in its substance. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
explanation, which is founded on what I cannot but regard
as a purely imaginary view of the functions of ganglionic
cells, must stand or fall with that hypothesis. A
long and arduous investigation has led me to doubt
whether in <i>any</i> case the heart’s movements are primarily
due to its ganglia; at all events, the same spontaneous
movements are observed in the hearts of molluscs and
crustaceans, which are without even a trace of ganglia;
and in the hearts of mammalian embryos long before
ganglia or nerve-fibres make their appearance. Not less
certain is it that movements of contraction and dilatation
are produced in the blood-vessels independently of all
central influence. This has been decisively proved by
the Italian physiologist, Mosso, when experimenting on an
organ isolated from the organism; and although the vessels
have their nerve cells and fibres, he justly doubts
whether it is to these that the stimulation is due, because
the phenomena are observed after the nervous vitality has
disappeared. Goltz severed all the tissues in the leg of a
rabbit, so that the only connection of the leg with the
rest of the body was through the crural vein and artery,
which kept up the circulation; yet although the nerves
of the skin were thus separated from their centre, so that
no sensation could be produced by stimulating the skin
of the leg, consequently no reflex from the centre on the
vessels, Goltz found that a marked reddening of the skin
from congestion of the capillaries followed the application
of mustard to the skin. Physiologists who believe that
the constriction and dilatation of blood-vessels are due to
the action of the ganglionic cells distributed over the
walls of the vessels will explain Goltz’s observation as a
case of reflex action; but those who agree with me that
such an hypothesis respecting the part played by the cells
is untenable, will class the observation among other cases
of direct stimulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
95. But passing from these perhaps questionable cases,
let us glance at other cases. The mobile iris of the bird
displays movements after the nerves have been divided.
Even the voluntary striped muscles are not altogether
motionless. Schiff divided the hypoglossus on one side,
and found, of course, the tongue paralyzed on that side;
but he also found that on the third day after the operation
some of the muscles of that side were quivering: the
agitation spread to others, till by the end of the fourth
day all the fibres were <i>rhythmically</i> contracting. From
this time onwards, the contractions were incessant;
though they were never able to move the tongue, because
the fibres did not contract simultaneously.</p>

<p>Schiff also observed that the hairs over the eyes and the
“whiskers” of cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs were for
months after section of their nerves in incessant rhythmical
vibration. This was observed when the animals
were asleep as when awake. Valentin records the spontaneous
movements in the diaphragm of animals just
killed; and this even after section of the phrenic nerve.
The same movements may be seen in the operculum of
fishes. Henle observed the spontaneous contractions of
the intercostal muscles; which Schiff confirms, adding
that the movements observed by him in cats and birds
were not simply contractions of some fibres, but of all the
muscles, so that three or four excised ribs rhythmically
contracted and expanded.</p>

<p>I have performed a great many experiments with a
view of determining this question, but the phenomena
were so variable that I refrain from adducing any,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
merely state the general result as one in harmony with
the foregoing examples. The great variability of the phenomena
depends upon the variable conditions of muscular
irritability and anatomical relations. When the heart of
one woman is found beating twenty-seven hours after
death, while in most men and women it ceases after a
few minutes, we must be prepared to find different, and
even contradictory phenomena under varying unknown
conditions. There is, however, a general agreement among
experimenters that muscular irritability increases after
separation from nerve-centres, and then quickly decreases
again.</p>

<p>96. Although the stimulation of muscles usually comes
<i>through</i> a nerve-centre, yet since the muscles do not derive
their Contractility from nerve-centres any stimulation
will suffice. Now since we have abundant proof
that sensory nerves are stimulated by certain organic
changes, by poisons in the blood, excess of carbonic acid,
etc., we are justified in concluding that motor nerves
will be stimulated in like manner, and thus muscular
movement be produced occasionally without the intervention
of a centre. Pressure on a motor nerve, or the
irritation which results from inflammation, will determine
contraction, or secretion directly. Recently, Erb and
Westphal have disclosed the fact that the leg will be
suddenly jerked out if the patella be gently tapped; and
they prove this not to be a reflex action, because it follows
with the same certainty after the skin has been
made insensible.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>There are doubtless many other phenomena which,
though commonly assigned to reflex stimulation, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
really due to direct stimulation. Research might profitably
be turned towards the elucidation of this point.
Since there is demonstrable evidence that a nerve when
no longer in connection with its centre, or with ganglionic
cells, may be excited by electricity, pressure, thermal and
chemical stimuli, we must conclude that even when it is
in connection with its centre, any local irritation from
pressure, changes in the circulation, etc., will also excite
it. But as such local excitations will have only local and
isolated effects, they will rarely be conspicuous.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT IS TAUGHT BY EMBRYOLOGY?</span></h2>
</div>

<p>97. <span class="firstword">Subject</span> to the qualification expressed in the last
chapter, stimulation of muscles and glands involves a
neural process in ingoing nerve, centre, and outgoing
nerve. These are the triple elements of the “nervous
arc.” If muscles were directly exposed to external influences,
they would be stimulated without the intervention
of a centre; but as a matter of fact they never are
thus exposed, being always protected by the skin. Did
the skin-nerves pass directly to the muscles underneath,
they would move those muscles, without the intervention
of a centre; but as a matter of fact the skin-nerves pass
directly to a centre, so that it is only <i>through</i> a centre
that they can act upon the muscles. Were muscles and
glands directly connected with sensitive surfaces, their
activity would indeed be awakened by direct stimulation;
but unless the muscles were so connected the one with
the other, by anastomosis of fibres or continuity of tissue,
that the movement of one was the movement of all, there
would need to be some other channel by which their separate
energies should be combined and co-ordinated. In
the higher organisms anastomosis of muscles is rare, and
the combination is effected by means of the nerves.</p>

<p>98. Although analysis distinguishes the two elements
of the neuro-muscular system, assigning separate properties
to the separate tissues, an interpretation of the phenomena
demands a synthesis, so that a movement is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
conceived as always involving Sensibility, and a sensation
as always involving Motility.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> In like manner, although
analysis distinguishes the various organs of the body,
assigning separate functions to each, our interpretation
demands their synthesis into an organism; and we have
thus to explain how the <i>whole</i> has different <i>parts</i>, and
how these different parts are brought into unity. Embryology
helps us to complete the fragmentary indications of
Anatomy and Physiology.</p>

<p>99. Take a newly laid egg, weigh it carefully, then
hatch it, and when the chick emerges, weigh both chick
and shell: you will find that there has been no increase
of weight. The semifluid contents have become transformed
into bones, muscles, nerves, tendons, feathers, beak,
and claws, all without increase of substance. There has
been <i>differentiation</i> of structure, nothing else. Oxygen
has passed into it from without; carbonic acid has passed
out of it. The molecular agitation of heat has been required
for the rearrangements of the substance. Without
oxygen there would have been no development.
Without heat there would have been none. Had the
shell been varnished, so as to prevent the due exchange
of oxygen and carbonic acid, no chick would have been
evolved. Had only one part of the shell been varnished,
the embryo would have been deformed.</p>

<p>99<i>a</i>. The patient labors of many observers (how patient
only those can conceive who have made such
observations!) have detected something of this wondrous
history, and enabled the mind to picture some of the incessant
separations and reunions, chemical and morphological.
Each stage of evolution presents itself as the
consequence of a preceding stage, at once an emergence
and a continuance; so that no transposition of stages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
is possible; each has its appointed place in the series
(<span class="smcap">Problem I.</span> § <a href="#I_107">107</a>). For in truth each stage is a <i>process</i>—the
sum of a variety of co-operant conditions. We,
looking forward, can foresee in each what it will become,
as we foresee the man in the lineaments of the infant;
but in this prevision we always presuppose that the
regular course of development will proceed unchecked
through the regular succession of special conditions: the
infant becomes a man only when this succession is uninterrupted.
Obvious as this seems, it is often disregarded;
and the old metaphysical conception of <i>potential</i> powers
obscures the real significance of Epigenesis. The potentiality
of the cells of the germinal membrane is simply
their capability of reaching successive stages of development
under a definite series of co-operant conditions.
We foresee the result, and personify our prevision. But
that result will not take place unless all the precise
changes that are needful serially precede it. A slight
pressure in one direction, insufficient to alter the chemical
composition of the tissue, may so alter its structure
as to disturb the regular succession of forms necessary to
the perfect evolution.</p>

<p>100. The egg is at first a microscopic cell, the nucleus
of which divides and subdivides as it grows. The egg
becomes a hollow sphere, the boundary wall of which is
a single layer of cells, all so similar that to any means
of appreciation we now possess they are indistinguishable.
They are all the progeny of the original nucleus and
yolk, or cell contents. Very soon, however, they begin
to show distinguishable differences, not perhaps in <i>kind</i>,
but in <i>degree</i>. The wall of this hollow sphere is rapidly
converted into the <i>germinal membrane</i>, out of which the
embryo is formed. Kowalewsky (confirmed by Balfour)
has pointed out how in the Amphioxus the hollow sphere
first assumes an oval shape, and then, by an indentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
of the under side, with corresponding curvature of the
upper side, presents somewhat the shape of a bowl. The
curvature increases, and the curved ends approaching
each other, the original cavity is reduced to a thin line
separating the upper from the under surface. The cavity
of the body is formed by the curving downwards of this
double layer of the germinal membrane.</p>

<p>101. This is not precisely the course observable in
other vertebrates; but in all, the germinal membrane,
which lies like a watch-glass on the surface of the yolk,
is recognizable as two distinct layers of very similar cells.
What do these represent? They are the starting-points
of the two great systems: Instrumental and Alimental.
The one yields the dermal surface; the other the mucous
membrane. Each follows an independent though analogous
career. The yolk furnishes nutrient material to the
germinal membrane, and so passes more or less directly
into the tissues; but unlike the germinal membrane, it
is not itself to any great extent the seat of generation by
segmentation. There are two yolks: the yellow and
the white (which must not be confounded with what is
called the <i>white of egg</i>); and their disposition may be
seen in the diagram (<a href="#ifig_14">Fig. 14</a>) copied from Foster and Balfour’s
work. The importance of the white yolk is that
it passes insensibly into a distinct layer of the germinal
membrane, between the two primary layers.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Each of
the three layers of the germinal membrane has its specific
character assigned to it by embryologists, who, however,
are not all in agreement. Some authorities regard the
topmost layer as the origin of the nervous system, the
epidermis, with hair, feathers, nails, horns, the cornea and
lens of the eye, etc. To the middle layer are assigned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
muscular and osseous systems, the sexual organs, etc. To
the innermost layer, the alimentary canal, with liver, pancreas,
gastric and enteric glands. Other authorities are
in favor of two primary layers: one for the nervous,
muscular, osseous, and dermal systems; the other for the
viscera and unstriped muscles. Between these two layers,
a third gradually forms, which is specially characterized
as the vascular.</p>

<p>102. Messrs. Foster and Balfour, avoiding the controverted
designations of serous, vascular, and mucous
layers, or of sensorial, motor germinative, and glandular
layers, employ designations which are independent of
theoretic interpretation, and simply describe the position
of the layers, namely, <i>epiblast</i> for the upper, <i>mesoblast</i> for
the middle, and <i>hypoblast</i> for the under layer. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
epiblast they derive the epidermis and central nervous
system (or would even limit the latter to the central gray
matter), together with some parts of the sense-organs.
From the mesoblast, the muscles, nerves (and probably
white matter of the centres), bones, connective tissue,
and blood-vessels. From the hypoblast, the epithelial
lining of the alimentary canal, trachea, bronchial tubes,
as well as the liver, pancreas, etc.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Kölliker’s suggestion
is much to the same effect, namely, that the three layers
may be viewed as two epithelial layers, between which
subsequently arises a third, the origin of nerves, muscles,
bones, connective tissue, and vessels.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>103. The way in which the history may be epitomized
is briefly this: There are two germinal membranes, respectively
representing the Instrumental and Alimental
Systems. Each membrane differentiates, by different appropriations
of the yolk substance, into three primary
layers, <i>epithelial</i>, <i>neural</i>, and <i>muscular</i>. In the epiblast,
or upper membrane, these layers represent: 1°, the future
epidermis with its derivatives—hair, feathers, nails, skin
glands, and chromatophores; 2°, the future nervous tissue;
3°, the future muscular tissue.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> (Bone, dermis,
connective tissue, and blood-corpuscles are subsequent
formations.)</p>

<p>The hypoblast, or under membrane, in an inverted
order presents a similar arrangement: 1°, the unstriped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
muscular tissue of viscera and vessels; 2°, the nervous
tissue of the sympathetic system; 3°, the epithelial lining
of the alimentary canal with its glands.</p>

<p>Fundamentally alike as these two membranes are, they
have specific differences; but in both we may represent
to ourselves the <i>embryological unit</i> constituted by an epithelial
cell, a nerve-cell, and a muscle-cell. All the other
cells and tissues are adjuncts, necessary, indeed, to the
working of the vital mechanism, but subordinated to the
higher organites.</p>

<p>104. This conception may be compared with that of
His in the division of Archiblast and Parablast assigned
by him to the germ and accessory germ.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> We can imagine,
he says, the whole of the connective substances
removed from the organism, and thus leave behind a
scaffolding in which brain and spinal cord would be the
axis, surrounded by muscles, glands, and epithelium, and
nerves as connecting threads. All these parts stand
in more or less direct relation to the nervous system.
All are continuous. By a similar abstraction we can
imagine this organic system removed, and leave behind
the connected scaffolding which is formed from the
accessory germ; but this latter has only <i>mechanical</i>
significance; the truly vital functions belong to the other
system.</p>

<p>105. The researches of modern histologists have all
converged towards the conclusion that the organs of
Sense are modifications of the surface, with epithelial
cells which on the one side are connected with terminal
hairs, or other elements adapted to the reception of
stimuli, and are connected on the other side through
nerve-fibres with the perceptive centres. It has been
shown that nerve-fibres often terminate in (or among)
epithelial cells—sensory fibres at the surface, and motor-fibres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
in the glands.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Whether the fibres actually penetrate
the substance of the cell, or not, is still disputed.
Enough for our present purpose to understand that there
is a <i>physiological</i> connection between the two, and above
all that sensory nerves are normally stimulated through
some epithelial structure or other.</p>

<div id="ifig_15" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">

<i>m f</i>, medullary fold, <i>c h</i>, notochord.</p></div></div>

<p>106. And this becomes clear when we go back to the
earliest indications of development. Look at <a href="#ifig_15">Fig. 15</a>, representing
a transverse section of the germinal membranes
in a chick after eighteen hours’ incubation. Here the
three layers, A, B, and C, have the aspect of simple cells
very slightly differing among each other. Yet since each
layer has ultimately a progeny which is characteristically
distinguishable, we may speak of each not as what it now
is, but what it will become. Although the most expert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
embryologist is often unable to distinguish the embryo of
a reptile from that of a bird or of a mammal, at certain
stages of evolution, so closely does the one resemble the
other, yet inasmuch as the embryo of a reptile does not,
cannot become a bird, nor that of a bird a mammal, he is
justified in looking forward to what each will become, and
in calling each embryo by its future name. On the same
ground, although we cannot point to any such distinction
between the layers of the blastoderm as I have indicated
in the separation of Instrumental and Alimental Systems,
nor specify any characters by which the cells can be recognized
as epithelial, neural, and muscular, yet a forward
glance prefigures these divisions. We know that the first
result of the segmentation of the yolk is the formation
of cells all alike, which in turn grow and subdivide into
other cells. We know that these cells become variously
modified both in composition and structure, and that by
such differentiations the simple organism becomes a complex
of organs.</p>

<p>107. But here it is needful to recall a consideration
sometimes disregarded, especially by those who speak of
Differentiation as if it were some magical Formative Principle,
quite independent of the state of the organized
substance which is formed. There is a luminous conception—first
announced by Goethe, and subsequently developed
by Milne Edwards—which regards the organism
as increasing in power and complexity by a physiological
“division of labor,” very similar to that division of employments
which characterizes the developed social organism.
But the metaphor has sometimes been misleading;
it has been interpreted as indicating that Function creates
Organ (see <span class="smcap">Problem I.</span> § <a href="#I_88">88</a>), and as if Differentiation
itself were something more than the expression of the
changes resulting from the introduction of different elements.
In the Social Organism a “division of labor”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
presupposes that laborers with their labor-materials are
already existing; the change is one of rearrangement:
instead of each laborer employing his skill in doing many
kinds of work, he restricts it to one kind, which he is
then able to do with less loss of time and power. Thus
is social power multiplied without increase of population,
and the social organism becomes more complex by the
differentiation of its organs. It is not precisely thus with
the Animal Organism during its evolution. Indeed to
suppose that the differentiation of the germinal membrane
into special tissues and organs takes place by any such
division of employments, is to fall into the ancient error
of assuming the organism to exist <i>preformed</i> in the ovum.
The unequivocal teaching of Epigenesis is that each part
is produced out of the elements furnished by previous
parts; and for every differentiation there must be a difference
in composition, structure, or texture—the first condition
being more important than the second, the second
more important than the third. The word protoplasm has
almost as wide a generality as the word animal, and is
often used in forgetfulness of its specific values: the protoplasm
of a nerve-cell is not the <i>same</i> as that of a blood-cell,
a muscle-cell, or a connective-tissue cell, any more
than a bee is a butterfly, or a prawn a lobster. No sooner
has the specific character been acquired, no sooner is one
organite formed by differentiation, than there is an absolute
barrier against any transformation of it into any other
kind of organite. The nerve-cell, muscle-cell, and epithelial
cell have a common starting-point, and a community
of substance; but the one can no more be transformed
into the other than a mollusc can be transformed
into a crustacean. In the homogeneous cellular mass
which subsequently becomes the “vertebral plates,” a
group of cells is very early differentiated: this is the
rudimentary spinal ganglion, which becomes enveloped in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
a membrane, and then pursues a widely different course
from that of the other cells surrounding it, so that “the
same cell which was formerly an element of the vertebral
plate now becomes a nerve-cell, while its neighbors become
cartilage-cells.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Indeed all the hypotheses of transformation
of tissues by means of Differentiation are as
unscientific as the hypotheses of the transformation of
animals. In the organism, as in the Cosmos, typical forms
once attained are retained. There probably was a time in
the history of the animal series when masses of protoplasm
by appropriating different materials from the surrounding
medium were differentiated into organisms more
complex and more powerful than any which existed before.
But it is obvious that from a common starting-point
there could have been no variations in development without
the introduction of new elements of composition:
there might have been many modifications of structure,
but unless these facilitated modifications of composition,
there could never have resulted the striking differences
observed in animal organisms.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>108. To return from this digression, we may liken the
three primary layers of the germinal membranes to the
scattered and slightly different masses of protoplasm out
of which the animal kingdom was developed. In this
early stage there are no individualized organites—no
nerve-cells or muscle-cells. They are cells ready to receive
modifications both of composition and structure,
appropriating slightly different elements from the yolk,
and according to such appropriation acquiring different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
properties. And this is necessarily so, since the different
cells have not exactly the same relation to the yolk, nor
are they in exactly the same relation to the incident forces
which determine the molecular changes. The uppermost
layer (epiblast) under such variations develops into epithelium
and central nerve-tissue; the epithelial cell cannot
develop into a nerve-cell, the two organites are markedly
unlike, yet both spring from a common root. Another
modification results in the development of muscle-cells
from the inner layer.</p>

<p>109. Hence we can understand how the surface is sensitive
even in organisms that are without nerve-tissue;
and also how even in the highest organisms there is an
intimate blending of epithelial with neural tissues. The
same indication explains the existence of neuro-muscular
cells in the <i>Hydra</i>, recorded by Kleinenberg, and of neuro-muscular
fibres in the <i>Beroë</i>, by Eimer.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> In the simpler
organisms the surface is at once protective, sensitive, and
absorbent. It shuts off the animal from the external
medium, and thus individualizes it; at the same time it
connects this individual with the medium; for it is the
channel through which the medium acts, both as food and
stimulus. The first morphological change is one whereby
a part of the surface is bent inwards, and forms the lining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
of the body’s cavity. Soon there follows such a modification
of structure between the outer and inner surfaces
(<i>ectoderm</i> and <i>endoderm</i>) that the one is mainly sensitive
and protective, the other mainly protective and absorbent.
The outer surface continues indeed to absorb, but its part
in this function is insignificant compared with that of the
inner surface, which not only absorbs but secretes fluids
essential to assimilation. The inner surface, although
sensitive, is subjected to less various stimulation, and its
sensibility is more uniform.</p>

<p>110. The uppermost of the primary layers we have
seen to be epithelial; and we know that the first lines of
the central nervous system are laid there. A depression
called the medullary groove is the first indication of the
future cerebro-spinal axis. Some writers—Kölliker, for
instance—regard this medullary groove as continuous
with but different from the epithelial layer; others maintain
that it lies underneath the epithelium, just as we see
it in later stages, when the differentiation between epithelial
and nerve cell has taken place. Since no one disputes
the fact that when the groove becomes a closed
canal its lining is epithelial, one of two conclusions is inevitable:
either the cells of the primary layer develop in
the two diverse directions, epithelial and neural; or else
epithelial cells can be developed on the surface of neural
cells and out of them. The latter conclusion is one
which, involving the conception of transformation, would
seem to be put out of court. I think, then, we must
admit that the under side of the primary layer of cells
becomes differentiated into nerve-cells; and this is in
accordance with the observations of Messrs. Foster and
Balfour.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
111. While there is this intimate morphological and
physiological blending of epithelial and neural organites,
there is an analogous relation between neural and muscular
organites. As the neural layer lies under the epithelial,
the muscular lies under the neural. The surface
stimulation passes to the centre, and is reflected on the
muscles. Embryology thus teaches why a stimulus from
the external medium must be propagated to a nerve-centre
before it reaches the muscles; and why a stimulus on one
part of the surface may set all the organism in movement,
by passing through a centre which co-ordinates all movements.
This, of course, only applies to the higher organisms.
In the simpler structures the sensitive surface is
directly continuous with the motor organs.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to pursue this interesting branch
of our subject; nor need we follow the analogous evolution
of the second germinal membrane representing the
Alimental System. Our attention must be given to what
is known and inferred respecting the elementary structure
of the nerves and centres, on which mainly the interest
of the psychologist settles, since to him the whole of
Physiology is merged in nerve actions.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ELEMENTARY STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>112. <span class="firstword">The</span> progress of science involves an ever-increasing
Analysis. Investigation is more and more directed
towards the separated details of the phenomena previously
studied as events; the observed facts are resolved into
their component factors, complex wholes into their simpler
elements, the organism into organs and tissues. But
while the analytical process is thus indispensable, it is, as
I have often to insist, beset with an attendant danger,
namely, that in drawing the attention away from one
group of factors to fix it exclusively on another, there is
a tendency to forget this artifice, and instead of restoring
the factors provisionally left out of account, we attempt
a reconstruction in oblivion of these omitted factors.
Hence, instead of studying the properties of a tissue in
all the elements of that tissue, and the functions of an
organ in the anatomical connections of that organ, a single
element of the tissue is made to replace the whole, and
very soon the function of the organ is assigned to this
particular element. The “superstition of the nerve-cell”
is a striking illustration. The cell has usurped the place
of the tissue, and has come to be credited with central
functions; so that wherever anatomists have detected
ganglionic cells, physiologists have not hesitated to place
central functions. By such interpretations the heart and
intestines, the glands and blood-vessels, have, erroneously,
I think, their actions assigned to ganglionic cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
It is unnecessary to point out the radical misconception
which thus vitiates a great mass of anatomical exposition
and physiological speculation. I only call the reader’s
attention to the point at the outset of the brief survey we
have now to make of what is known respecting the elementary
structure of the nervous system.</p>

<h3 id="sec_16">DIFFICULTIES OF THE INVESTIGATION.</h3>

<p>113. So great and manifold are the difficulties of the
search, that although hundreds of patient observers have
during the last forty years been incessantly occupied with
the elementary structure of the nervous system, very little
has been finally established. Indeed, we may still repeat
Lotze’s sarcasm, that “microscopic theories have an average
of five years’ duration.” This need not damp our
ardor, though it ought to check a too precipitate confidence.
Nothing at the present moment needs more recognition
by the student than that the statements confidently
repeated in text-books and monographs are very
often for the most part only ingenious guesses, in which
Observation is to Imagination what the bread was to the
sack in Falstaff’s tavern bill. Medical men and psychologists
ought to be warned against founding theories of
disease, or of mental processes, on such very insecure
bases; and physiological students will do well to remember
the large admixture of Hypothesis which every description
of the nervous system now contains. Not that
the potent aid of Hypothesis is to be undervalued; but
its limits must be defined. It may be used as a finger-post,
not as a foundation. It may suggest a direction in
which truth may be sought; it cannot take the place of
Observation. It may link together scattered facts; it
must not take the place of a fact. We are glad of corks
until we have learned to swim. We are glad of a suggestion
which will for the nonce fill up the gaps left by observation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
and hold the facts intelligibly together. And
both as suggestion and colligation, Hypothesis is indispensable.
Indeed, every <i>discovery</i> is a verified hypothesis;
and there is no discovery until verification has been
gained: up to this point it was a guess, which might have
been erroneous—a torchbearer sent out to look for a
missing child in one direction, while the child was wandering
in another; only when he finds the child can we
acknowledge that the torchbearer pursued the right path.
Hypothesis satisfies the intellectual need of an explanation,
but we must be wary lest we accept this fulfilment
of a need as equivalent to an enlargement of knowledge;
we must not accept explanation as demonstration, and
suppose that because we can form a mental picture of the
possible stages of an event, therefore this picture represents
the actual stages. Let us be alert, forewarned
against the tendency to seek evidence in support of a
conclusion, instead of seeking to unfold the conclusion
step by step from the evidence. To seek for evidence in
support of a <i>guess</i> is very different from seeking it in support
of a <i>conclusion</i>; which latter practice is like that of
people asking advice, and only following it when it chimes
in with their desires.</p>

<p id="II_114">114. Is not the warning needed, when we find anatomists
guided by certain “physiological postulates,” and
consequently <i>seeing</i> only what these postulates demand?
For example, there is the postulate of “isolated conduction,”
which is said to require that every nerve-fibre
should pursue its course singly from centre to periphery.
Accordingly the fibres are described as unbranched.
Whatever may be the demand of the postulate, or the
felt necessity of the deduction, the fact is that nerve-fibres
do branch off during their course at various points;
nay, it is doubtful whether any lengthy fibre is unbranched.
Other postulates demand what fact plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
denies. It is said to be “necessary” that every cell
should have at least two fibres, and that sensory and
motor nerves should be directly connected through their
respective cells. These things cannot be seen, but they
are described with unhesitating precision. Diagrams are
published in which the sensory fibres pass into the cells
of the posterior horn of the spinal cord, and these cells
send off prolongations to the cells of the anterior horn,
and thence the motor fibres pass out to the muscles: an
absolutely impossible arrangement, according to our present
data! Again, the postulate that nerve-force originates
in the cells, and that nerve-functions depend on cells, required
that the cells should be most abundant where the
function was most energetic. Of course they were found
most abundant in the required places—no notice whatever
being taken of the facts which directly contradicted
the deduction.</p>

<p>115. Among the serious obstacles to research we must
reckon this tendency to substitute Imaginary Anatomy
for Objective Anatomy. I am conscious of the tendency
in myself, as I note it in others; and have constantly to
struggle against it, though not perhaps always aware of
it. Many a time have I had to relinquish plausible explanations,
which would have supported my speculations
could I but have believed that they represented the facts;
but being unable to believe this, I had to remember that
hypotheses and explanations appear and disappear—only
the solid fact lives. If there is one lesson emphatically
taught by Philosophy, it is the unwisdom of founding
our conclusions on our desires rather than on the objective
facts.</p>

<p>116. In the following pages a constantly critical attitude
is preserved: this is simply to keep active the sense
of how much is still needed to be done before a satisfactory
theory of the nervous system can be worked out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
The objective difficulties are greater than in any other
department of Anatomy. The problem is to form a precise
picture of what the organites are, and of how they
are arranged in the living tissue; yet our present means
of investigation involve as a preliminary that we should
<i>alter</i> that arrangement, <i>removing</i> some elements of the
tissue, and <i>changing</i> the state of others, without knowing
what were their precise state and arrangement before the
change. Place a piece of nerve-tissue under the microscope,
without having subjected it to various mechanical
and chemical operations, and you can see next to nothing
of its structure. You must tear the parts asunder, and
remove the fat and nerve-sap (plasmode) before you can
see anything; you must coagulate the albumen, and otherwise
chemically alter the substances before a thin section
can be made; you must get rid of the tissues in which it
is embedded, without knowing what are the connections
thus destroyed. Living neurine has no greater consistence
than cream, often no greater than oil. How, then,
can thin sections be made until this viscid substance has
been hardened by alcohol or acids? But substances
thus acted on lose their constituent water, which can no
more be removed without alteration of their structure,
than it can be removed from certain salts without destruction
of their special properties. Losing their water
alone, they become deformed. They lose much more.
Sometimes the loss can be estimated, as in the case of
the hyaline substance investing the nucleus during the
process of segmentation in embryonic cells, which may
be seen to disappear when a weak solution of acid is applied.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
At other times we are unable to say what has
disappeared. Under different modes of preparation very
different appearances are observed, and anatomists are
accordingly at variance. Yet unless some hardening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
method be adopted little can be seen! Stilling, who has
given his life to the study, declares that no results are
reliable which are obtained from the unprepared tissue,
because the mechanical isolation of the elements destroys
the textural arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> There is one method of
hardening, and only one, which we can be certain does
not chemically alter the structure, and that is the freezing
method. The experiments of Dr. Weir Mitchell and Dr.
Richardson prove this, because they prove that the brain
of the living animal may be frozen and frozen again and
again, yet recover its vital activity when thawed. Professor
Rutherford has invented an admirable instrument
for making sections of the frozen tissue, of any delicacy
that may be required; but with the thinnest section there
will still be certain difficulties of observation, unless the
tissue has undergone a staining process. Whatever is
seen, however, in the frozen tissue is to be accepted as
normal.</p>

<p>117. Two points must be determined before reliance
can be placed on observations of tissues chemically acted
on: First, we must prove that the forms now visible existed
before the preparation—the chemical action merely
unveiling them; secondly, we must estimate the part
played by the elements which have been removed in
order to make the rest visible. We know, for example,
that the nucleus often exists in the cell, though an acid
may be needed to make it visible. We also know that
cells which during life are quite free from visible granules
are distinctly granulated after death, even without external
chemical action. Imagine the explanation of a
steam-engine to be attempted by first taking it to pieces,
and examining these pieces, with no account of the coals
and steam which had previously been <i>removed</i> in order
to facilitate the examination. When we know the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
played by coals and steam, we may disregard these items
of the active machine. So when we know the part
played by water, fat, amorphous substance, and plasmode,
we may describe nerve-tissue without taking these into
account.</p>

<p id="II_118">118. “You have convinced me,” said Rasselas to Imlac,
“that it is impossible to be a poet.” My readers may,
perhaps, infer from this enumeration of the difficulties
that a knowledge of the minute anatomy of the nervous
system is impossible. Not so; but a knowledge of these
difficulties should impress us with the necessity for a
vigilant scepticism, and the search after new methods. If
the difficulties are fairly faced, they may be finally overcome.
What we must resign ourselves to at present is
the conviction that our knowledge is not sufficiently accurate
to be employed as a basis of deduction in the explanation
of physiological and psychological processes.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>119. Having said so much, let me add that there are
some positive materials, and these yearly receive additions.
The organites are described with a general agreement
as to their composition and structure—although
there is much that is hypothetical even here. Neurine is
known under two aspects: the amorphous and the figured.
The figured, which is the better known, comprises cells of
different kinds, fibres and fibrils. The amorphous, more
generally called <i>Neuroglia</i>, or nerve-cement, is less understood,
and is indeed by many authorities excluded altogether
from the nerve-tissue proper, and relegated to the
class of connective tissues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_17">THE NERVE-CELL.</h3>

<p>120. It is unfortunate that the term nerve-cell is applied
to organites of very variable structure. Nerve-cell
is a generic term of which the species are many; under it
are designated organites in different stages—as infancy,
childhood, and manhood are all included under Man.
Most commonly by nerve-cell is understood the ganglionic
corpuscle, conspicuous in its size and its prolongations,
such as it appears in the great centres, and in
ganglia. It also designates smaller different organites,
sometimes called “nuclei” (<i>Kerne</i>), sometimes grains
(<i>Körner</i>). There would be advantage in designating the
earlier stages as <i>neuroblasts</i>, reserving the word <i>cells</i> for
the more developed forms. Such a distinction would
facilitate the discussion of whether nerve-fibres had or
had not their origin in cells; because while I, for one, see
very coercive evidence against the accepted notion that
all the fibres have their origin in the processes of ganglionic
corpuscles, I see no reason to doubt that both
fibres and corpuscles have their origin in neuroblasts.
Of this anon.</p>

<p>The cell is a composite organite, the primary element
being a microscopic mass of protoplasm, or what may
more conveniently be termed <i>neuroplasm</i>. It appears as
finely granulated and striated or fibrillated substance on
a hyaline ground, with water, fat, and diffused pigment
in varying quantities. The cell contains a nucleus, and
nucleolus—sometimes two. Like other animal cells, it
sometimes has a distinct cell-wall, sometimes not. Its
size and shape are variable: sometimes distinctly visible
to the naked eye, generally visible only under the microscope.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
It is round, oval, pyramidal, club-shaped, pear-shaped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
or many-cornered. It has one, two, three, or
many outgrowths called “processes,” and according to the
processes it is known as unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar.
When there are no processes the cell is called apolar.
Some idea of these processes may be formed if they are
likened to the pseudopodia of Amœbæ and Foraminifera.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Compare <a href="#ifig_16">Fig. 16</a>, a nerve-cell, figured by Gerlach, with
<a href="#ifig_17">Fig. 17</a>, one highly magnified, in which Max Schultze’s
hypothesis is represented.</p>

<p>121. Such is a general description of the nerve-cell as
it is seen in various places, and under various modes of
preparation. How much is due to preparation we cannot
positively say. While we always discover fibrine
in the blood after it is withdrawn from the vessels, we
know that fibrine as such does not exist in the circulating
blood. And if neurine is a semi-liquid substance, we may
doubt whether in the living cell it is fibrillated. Doubts
have been thrown even on the normal existence of the
granular substance, which has been attributed to coagulation.
Thus we know that the nucleus of the white blood-corpuscle
appears perfectly homogeneous until subjected
to heat, yet at a certain temperature (86° F.) it assumes
the aspect of a fine network. Haeckel observed the hyaline
substance of the neurine in crayfish become troubled
and changed directly any fluid except its own blood-serum
came in contact with it. Leydig noticed the transparent
ganglion of a living Daphnia become darker and darker
as the animal died; and I saw something like this, after
prolonged struggles of a Daphnia to escape from a thread
in which its leg was entangled. Charles Robin, indeed,
asserts that the passage from the hyaline to the finely
granulated state is a characteristic of the dying cell.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the other hand, it should be noted that Max Schultze describes
a fibrillated appearance in cells just removed from
the living animal, and placed in serum.</p>

<p>When, therefore, one observer describes the neuroplasm
as being clear as water, another as finely granular, and a
third as fibrillated, we must conclude that the observations
refer to cells, 1°, under different states of vitalization,
or, 2°, under different modes of preparation. On the first
head we note that some nerve-cells are so perishable that
Trinchese declares he could find no cells in the ganglia
of a cuttlefish which had been dead twenty-four hours,
although they were abundant in one recently killed.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> On
the second head we note that the changes wrought by
modes of preparation cannot be left out of consideration.
Auerbach notices that the cells and fibres apparent in the
<i>plexus myentericus</i> after an acid has been applied, cannot
be detected before that application—nothing is visible
but a pale gelatinous network, with here and there knots
of a paler hue; and I remember my surprise on examining
the fresh spinal cord of a duck-embryo, and finding
no trace of cells such as I had that very morning seen in
the cord of a chick of earlier date, but which had been
soaked in weak bichromate of potash. Now we have
excellent grounds for believing that in both cases these
organites were present, and that it was the reagent which
disclosed their presence in the chick; and so in other
cases we must ask whether the forms which appear under
a given mode of preparation are simply <i>unmasked</i>, or are
in truth <i>produced</i> by the reagent? This question we can
rarely answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
If one of the very large cells be taken from the ganglion
of a living mollusc, and be gently pressed till it
bursts, the discharged contents will be seen to be of a
hyaline viscid substance, with fine granules but no trace
of fibres. Yet we must not rashly generalize from this,
and declare that in the vertebrate cells the substance is
not also fibrillated. As a good deal of speculation rests
on the assumption of the fibrillated cell-contents, I have
thought it worth while to note the uncertainty which
hovers round it.</p>

<p>122. Among the uncertainties must be reckoned the
question as to the cell-processes. The existence of apolar
and unipolar cells is flatly denied by many writers, who
assert that the appearances are due to the fragility of the
processes. Fragile the processes are, and evidence of their
having been broken off meet us in every preparation; but
the denial of apolar and unipolar cells seems to me only
an example of the tendency to substitute hypothesis for
observation (§ <a href="#II_114">114</a>). The “postulate” which some seem
to regard as a “necessity of thought” that every nerve-cell
shall have at least two fibres, one ingoing, the other
outgoing, is allowed to override the plain evidence.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> It
originated in the fact first noticed by Wagner and Charles
Robin that certain cells in the spinal ganglia of fishes are
bipolar. The fact was rapidly generalized, in spite of its
not being verified in <i>other</i> places; the generalization was
accepted because (by a strange process of reasoning running
counter to all physiological knowledge) it was
thought to furnish an elementary illustration of the reflex
process. As the centre had its ingoing and outgoing
nerve, so the cell was held to be a centre “writ small,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
and required its two fibres, No one paused to ask, how a
cell placed in the <i>track</i> of an ingoing nerve could fulfil
this office of a reflex centre; no one supposed that the
portion of the sensory fibre which continued its course,
after the interruption of the cell, was a motor fibre.</p>

<p>What does Observation teach? It teaches that at first
all nerve-cells are apolar. Even in the cortex of the cerebrum,
where (unless we include the nuclei and grain-like
corpuscles under cells) all the cells are finally multipolar,
there is not one which has a process, up to the seventh or
eighth day of incubation (in the chick); from that day,
and onwards, cells with one process appear; later on,
cells with two, and later still, with three. By this time
all the apolar cells have disappeared. They may therefore
be regarded as cells in their infancy. However that
may be, we must accept the fact that apolar cells exist;
whether they can co-operate in neural functions, is a
question which must be decided after the mode of operation
of cells is placed beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>123. If apolar cells are embryonic forms of cells which
afterwards become multipolar, this interpretation will not
suffice for the unipolar cells. They are not only abundant,
but are mature forms in some organs, and in some
animals; though in some organs they may truly be regarded
as embryonic. Thus in the human embryo up to
the fourth month all the cells of the spinal cord are said
to be unipolar,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> later on they become multipolar. But in
birds, rabbits, dogs, and even man, the cells in the spinal
ganglia are mainly (if not wholly) unipolar;<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> nor is there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
any difficulty in observing the same fact in the œsophageal
ganglia of molluscs (see <a href="#ifig_22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<p>Such are the observations. They have indeed been
forced into agreement with the bipolar postulate, by the
assumption that the single process branches into two, one
afferent, the other efferent.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> But before making observation
thus pliant to suit hypothesis, it would be well to
look more closely into the evidence for the hypothesis
itself. For my own part, I fail to see the justification of
the postulate; whereas the existence of unipolar cells is
an observation which has been amply verified.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 18.—<i>Supposed union of two nerve-cells and a fibre.</i> The processes subdivide into a minute network, in which the fibre also loses itself.</div></div>

<p id="II_124">124. Bipolar cells abound; multipolar cells are still
more abundant; and these are the cells found in the gray
substance of the neural axis. Deiters, in his epoch-making
work,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> propounded an hypothetic <i>schema</i> which has
been widely accepted. Finding that the large cells in
the anterior horn of the spinal cord gave off processes of
different kinds, one branched, the other unbranched, he
held that the latter process was the origin of the axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
cylinder of a nerve-fibre, whereas the branched process
was protoplasm which divided and subdivided, and formed
the connection between one cell and another. Gerlach has
modified this by supposing that the minute fibrils of the
branching process reunite and form an axis cylinder (<a href="#ifig_18">Fig. 18</a>).
There is no doubt that some processes terminate in a
fine network; and there is a probability (not more) that
the unbranched process is always continuous with the
axis cylinder of a motor nerve, as we know it sometimes
is with that of a dark-bordered fibre in the white substances.
This, though probable, is, however, very far
from having been demonstrated. Once or twice Kölliker,
Max Schultze, and Gerlach have followed this unbranched
process as far as the <i>root</i> of a motor nerve; and they infer
that although it could not be traced further, yet it did
really join an axis cylinder there. In support Of this inference
came the observations of Koschennikoff,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> that in
the cerebrum and cerebellum, processes were twice seen
continuous with dark-bordered nerve-fibres. But the extreme
rarity of such observations amid thousands of cells
is itself a ground for hesitation in accepting a generalized
interpretation, the more so since we have Henle’s observation
of the similar entrance of a <i>branched</i> process into
the root.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Now it must be remembered that the branched
process is by no anatomist at present regarded as the
origin of the axis cylinder; so that if it can enter the
root without being the origin of a nerve-fibre, we are not
entitled to assume that the entrance of the unbranched
process has any other significance (on this head compare
§ <a href="#II_145">145</a>), especially when we reflect that no trustworthy
observer now professes to have followed a nerve-fibre of
the posterior root right into a multipolar cell. Figures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
indeed, have been published which show this, and much
else; but such figures are diagrams, not copies of what is
seen. They belong to Imaginary Anatomy.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The relation
of the cell-process to the nerve-fibre will be discussed

<p>125. A word in passing on the contradictory assertions
respecting the anastomosis of nerve-cells. That the gray
substance forms a <i>continuum</i> of some kind is certain from
the continuity of propagation of a stimulus. But it is by
no means certain that one cell is directly united to its
neighbor by a cell-process. Eminent authorities assert
that such direct union never takes place; others, that it
is a rare and insignificant fact; others, that it is constant,
and “demanded by physiological postulates.” I will not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
in the presence of distinct affirmations, venture to deny
that such appearances as are presented in <a href="#ifig_19">Fig. 19</a> may
occasionally be observed; the more so as I have myself
seen perhaps half a dozen somewhat similar cases; but it
is the opinion of Deiters and Kölliker that all such appearances
are illusory.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Granting that such connections
occur, we cannot grant this to be the normal mode; especially
now the more probable supposition is that the connection
is normally established by means of the delicate
ramifications of the branching processes.</p>

<p>Imaginary Anatomy has not been content with the cells
of the anterior horn being thus united together, to admit
of united action, but has gone further, and supposed that
the cells of the posterior horn, besides being thus united,
send off processes which unite them with the cells of the
anterior horn—and thus a pathway is formed for the
transmission of a sensory impression, and its conversion
into a motor impulse. What will the reader say when
informed that not only has no eye ever beheld such a
pathway, but that the first step—the direct union of the
sensory nerve-fibre with a cell in the <i>posterior</i> horn—is
confessedly not visible?</p>

<p>126. The foregoing criticisms will perhaps disturb the
reader who has been accustomed to theorize on the data
given in text-books; but he may henceforward be more
cautious in accepting such data as premises for deduction,
and will look with suspicion on the many theories which
have arisen on so unstable a basis. When we reflect how
completely the modern views of the nervous system, and
the physiological, pathological, and psychological explanations
based on these views, are dominated by the current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
notions of the nerve-cell, it is of the last importance
that we should fairly face the fact that at present our
knowledge even of the structure of the nerve-cell is extremely
imperfect; and our knowledge of the part it plays—its
anatomical relations and its functional relations—is
little more than guesswork!</p>

<h3 id="sec_18">THE NERVES.</h3>

<p>127. We now pass to the second order of organites;
and here our exposition will be less troubled by hesitations,
for although there is still much to be learned about
the structure and connections of the nerve-fibres, there is
also a solid foundation of accurate knowledge.</p>

<p>Fig. 20.—<i>a</i>, axis cylinder
formed by the fibrils of the cell
contents, and at <i>a’</i> assuming
the medullary sheath; <i>b</i>, naked
axis cylinder from spinal cord.</p></div></div>

<p>A nerve is a bundle of fibres within a membranous
envelope supplied with blood-vessels. Each fibre has
also its separate sheath, having annular constrictions at
various intervals. It is more correctly named by many
French anatomists a nerve-<i>tube</i> rather than a nerve-<i>fibre</i>;
but if we continue to use the term <i>fibre</i>, we must reserve
it for those organites which have a membranous sheath,
and thereby distinguish it from the more delicate <i>fibril</i>
which has none.</p>

<p>The nerve tube or fibre is thus constituted: within the
sheath lies a central band of neuroplasm identical with
the neuroplasm of nerve-cells, and known as the <i>axis cylinder</i>;
surrounding this band is an envelope of whitish
substance, variously styled <i>myeline</i>, <i>medullary sheath</i>, and
<i>white substance of Schwann</i>: it is closely similar to the
chief constituent of the yolk of egg, and to its presence
is due the whitish color of the fibres, which in its absence
are grayish. The axis cylinder must be understood as
the primary and essential element, because not only are
there nerve-fibrils destitute both of sheath and myeline
yet fulfilling the office of Neurility, but at their terminations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
both in centres and in muscles,
the nerve-fibres always lose
sheath and myeline, to preserve
only the neuroplasmic threads of
which the axis cylinder is said to
be composed. In the lowest fishes,
in the invertebrates, and in the so-called
sympathetic fibres of vertebrates,
there is either no myeline,
or it is not separated from the neuroplasm.</p>

<p>128. Nerve-fibres are of two kinds—1°.
The <i>dark-bordered</i> or <i>medullary</i>
fibres, which have both sheath
and myeline, as in the peripheral
system; or only myeline, without
the sheath, as in the central system.
2°. The <i>non-medullary</i> fibres,
which have the sheath, without appreciable
myeline—such are the
fibres of the olfactory, and the pale
fibres of the sympathetic.</p>

<p>Nerve-fibrils are neuroplasmic
threads of extreme delicacy, visible
only under high magnifying powers
(700–800), which abound in the
centres, where they form networks.
The fibrils also form the terminations
of the fibres. Many fibrils
are supposed to be condensed in
one axis cylinder. This is represented
by Max Schultze in <a href="#ifig_17">Figs. 17</a> and <a href="#ifig_20">20</a>.</p>

<p>129. As may readily be imagined,
the semi-liquid nature of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
neuroplasm throws almost insuperable difficulties in the
way of accurately determining whether the axis cylinder
in the living nerve is fibrillated or not; whether,
indeed, any of the aspects it presents in our preparations
are normal. Authorities are not even agreed as to
whether it is a pre-existent solid band of homogeneous
substance, or a bundle of primitive fibrils, or a product
of coagulation.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Rudanowsky’s observations on
frozen nerves convinced him that the cylinder is a tubule
with liquid contents.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> My own investigations of the
nerves of insects and molluscs incline me to the view of
Dr. Schmidt of New Orleans, namely, that the cylinder
axis consists of minute granules arranged in rows and
united by a homogeneous interfibrillar substance, thus
forming a bundle of granular fibrils enclosed in a delicate
sheath<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>—in other words, a streak of neuroplasm which
has a fibrillar disposition of its granules. We ought to
expect great varieties in such streaks of neuroplasm; and
it is quite conceivable that in the Rays and the Torpedo
there are axis cylinders which are single fibrils, and others
which are bundles, with finely granulated interfibrillar
substance.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>The fibres often present a varicose aspect, as represented
in <a href="#ifig_21">Fig. 21</a>. It is, however, so rarely observed in the fresh
tissue, that many writers regard it (as well as the double
contour) as the product of preparation.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> It is, indeed,
always visible after the application of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
We need say no more at present respecting the structure
of nerve-fibres, except to point out that we have here
an organite not less complex than the cell.</p>

<h3 id="sec_19">THE NEUROGLIA.</h3>

<p>130. Besides cells and fibres, there is the <i>amorphous
substance</i>, which constitutes a great part of the central
tissue, and also enters largely into the peripheral tissue.
It consists of finely granular substance, and a network of
excessively delicate fibrils, with nuclei interspersed. Its
character is at present <i>sub judice</i>. Some writers hold it
to be nervous, the majority hold it to be simply one of
the many forms of connective tissue: hence its name
neuroglia, or nerve-cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
In the convolutions of the frozen brain Walther finds
the cells and fibres imbedded in a structureless semi-fluid
substance wholly free from granules; the granules only
appear there when cells have been crushed. It is to this
substance he attributes the fluctuation of the living brain
under the touch, like that of a mature abscess; the solidity
which is felt after death is due to the coagulation of
this substance. Unhappily we have no means of determining
whether the network visible under other modes
of investigation is present, although invisible, in this substance.
The neuroglia, as it appears in hardened tissues,
must therefore be described with this doubt in our minds.</p>

<p>If we examine a bit of central gray substance where
the cells and fibres are sparse, we see, under a low power,
a network of fibrils in the meshes of which lie nerve-cells.
Under very high powers we see outside these cells another
network of excessively fine fibrils embedded in a
granular ground substance, having somewhat the aspect
of hoar-frost, according to Boll. It is supposed that the
first network is formed by the ultimate ramifications of
the nerve-cell processes, and that the second is formed by
ramifications of the processes of <i>connective</i> cells. In this
granular, gelatinous, fibrillar substance nuclei appear, together
with small multipolar cells not distinguishable
from nerve-cells except in being so much smaller. These
nuclei are more abundant in the tissue of young animals,
and more abundant in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum.
The granular aspect predominates the fresher the
specimen, though there is always a network of fibrils; so
that some regard the granules as the result of a resolution
of the fibrils, others regard the fibrils as the linear crystallization
(so to speak) of the granules.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
131. Such is the aspect of the neuroglia. I dare not
venture to formulate an opinion on the histological question
whether this amorphous substance is neural, or partly
neural and partly connective (a substance which is potentially
both, according to Deiters and Henle), or wholly
connective. The question is not at present to be answered
decisively, because what is known as connective
tissue has also the three forms of multipolar cells, fibrils,
and amorphous substance; nor is there any decisive mark
by which these elements in the one can be distinguished
from elements in the other. The physical and chemical
composition of Neuroglia and Neuroplasm are as closely
allied as their morphological structure. And although in
the later stages of development the two tissues are markedly
distinguishable, in the early stages every effort has
failed to furnish a decisive indication.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Connective tissue
is dissolved by solutions which leave nerve-tissue intact.
Can we employ this as a decisive test? No, for if we
soak a section of the spinal cord in one of these solutions,
the <i>pia mater</i> and the membranous septa which ramify
from it between the cells and fibres disappear, leaving all
the rest unaltered. This proves that Neuroglia is at any
rate chemically different from ordinary connective tissue,
and more allied to the nervous. As to the <i>staining</i>
process, so much relied on, nothing requires greater caution
in its employment. Stieda found that the same
parts were sometimes stained and sometimes not; and
Mauthner observed that in some cells both contents and
nucleolus were stained, while the nucleus remained clear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
in other cells the contents remained clear; and some of
the axis cylinders were stained, the others not.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Lister
found that the connective tissue between the fibres of the
sciatic nerve, as well as the <i>pia mater</i>, were stained like
the axis cylinders;<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> and in one of my notes there is the
record of both (supposed) connective cells and nerve-cells
being stained alike, while the nerve-fibres and the (supposed)
connective fibres were unstained. Whence I conclude
that the supposition as to the nature of the one
group being different from that of the other was untenable,
if the staining test is to be held decisive.</p>

<p>132. The histological question is raised into undue importance
because it is supposed to carry with it physiological
consequences which would deprive the neuroglia
of active co-operation in neural processes, reducing it
to the insignificant position of a mechanical support. I
cannot but regard this as due to the mistaken tendency
of analytical interpretation, which somewhat arbitrarily
fastens on one element in a complex of elements, and
assigns that one as the sole agent. Whether we call the
neuroglia connective or neural, it plays an essential part in
all neural processes, probably a more important part than
even the nerve-cells, which usurp exclusive attention!
To overlook it, or to assign it a merely <i>mechanical</i>
office, seems to me as unphysiological as to overlook
blood-serum, and recognize the corpuscles as the only
nutrient elements. The notion of the neuroglia being a
mere vehicle of support for the blood-vessels arises from
not distinguishing between the alimental and instrumental
offices. In the function of a limb, bone is a co-operant.
In the function of a centre, connective tissue
is a co-operant; so that even if we acknowledge neuroglia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
to be a special form of connective tissue, it is an agent in
neural processes; <i>what</i> its agency is, will be hereafter
considered.</p>

<p>Following Bidder and Kupffer, the Dorpat school proclaimed
the whole of the gray substance of the posterior
half of the spinal cord to be connective tissue; and Blessig
maintained that the whole of the retina, except the
optic fibres, was connective tissue.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Even those anatomists
who regarded this as exaggerated, admitted that
connective tissue largely enters into the gray substance,
especially if the granular ground substance be reckoned
as connective, the nerve-cells being very sparse in the
posterior region. Be it so. Let us admit that the gray
matter of the frog’s spinal cord is mainly composed of
neuroglia, in which a very few multipolar nerve-cells are
embedded. What must our conclusion be? Why, that
since this spinal cord is proved to be a centre of energetic
and manifold reflex actions—even to the extent of
forcing many investigators to attribute sensation and volition
to it—this is proof that connective tissue does the
work of nerve-tissue, and that the neuroglia is more important
than nerve-cells!</p>

<p>Three hypotheses are maintainable—1°. The neuroglia
is the amorphous ground-substance of undeveloped tissue
(neuroplasm) out of which the cells and fibres of nerve-tissue
and connective tissue are evolved. 2°. It is the
product of dissolved nerve cells and fibres. 3°. It is the
undeveloped stage of connective tissue. For physiological
purposes we may adopt any one of these views, provided
we keep firm hold of the fact that the neuroglia is
an essential element, and in the centres a dominant
element. To make this clear, however, we must inquire
more closely into the relations of the three elements,
nerve-cells, fibres, and neuroglia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_20">THE RELATIONS OF THE ORGANITES.</h3>

<p>133. In enumerating among the obstacles to research
the tendency to substitute hypothetic deductions in place
of objective facts, I had specially in my mind the wide-reaching
influence of the reigning theories of the nerve-cell.
Had we a solidly established theory of the cell,
equivalent, say, to our theory of gas-pressure, we should
still need caution in allowing it to override exact observation;
but insecure as our data are, and hypothetical as
are the inferences respecting the part played by the cell,
the reliance placed on deductions from such premises is
nothing less than superstition. Science will take a new
start when the whole question is reinvestigated on a preliminary
setting aside of all that has been precipitately
accepted respecting the office of the cell. This exercise
of the imagination, even should the reigning theories
subsequently be confirmed, would not fail to bring many
neglected facts into their rightful place.</p>

<p>I am old enough to remember when the cell held a
very subordinate position in Neurology, and now my
meditations have led me to return, if not to the old views
of the cell, at least to something like the old estimate of
its relative importance. Its existence was first brought
prominently forward by Ehrenberg in 1834, who described
its presence in the sympathetic ganglia; and by
Remak in 1837, who described it in the spinal ganglia.
For some time afterwards the ganglia and centres were
said to contain irregular masses of vesicular matter which
were looked on as investing the fibres; what their office
was, did not appear. But there rapidly arose the belief
that the cells were minute batteries in which “nerve-force”
was developed, the fibres serving merely as conductors.
Once started on this track, Hypothesis had free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
way, and a sort of fetichistic deification of the cell invested
it with miraculous powers. In many works of
repute we meet with statements which may fitly take
their place beside the equally grave statements made by
savages respecting the hidden virtues of sticks and stones.
We find the nerve-cells credited with “metabolic powers,”
which enable them to “spiritualize impressions, and materialize
ideas,” to <i>transform</i> sensations into movements,
and <i>elaborate</i> sensations into thoughts; not only have
they this “remarkable aptitude of metabolic local action,”
they can also “act at a distance.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> The savage believes
that one pebble will cure diseases, and another render him
victorious in war; and there are physiologists who believe
that one nerve-cell has sensibility, another motricity, a
third instinct, a fourth emotion, a fifth reflexion: they
do not say this in so many words, but they assign to cells
which differ only in size and shape, specific qualities.
They describe sensational, emotional, ideational, sympathetic,
reflex, and motor-cells; nay, Schröder van der
Kolk goes so far as to specify hunger-cells and thirst-cells.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
With what grace can these writers laugh at
Scholasticism?</p>

<p>134. The hypothesis of the nerve-cell as the fountain
of nerve-force is supported by the gratuitous hypothesis of
cell-substance having greater chemical tension and molecular
instability than nerve-fibre. No evidence has been
furnished for this; indeed the only experimental evidence
bearing on this point, if it has any force, seems directly
adverse to the hypothesis. I allude to the experiments
of Wundt, which show that the faint stimulus capable
of moving a muscle when applied directly to its nerve,
must be increased if the excitation has to pass through
the cells by stimulation of the sensory nerve.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> Wundt
interprets this as proving that the cells retard every impulse,
whereby they are enabled to store up latent force.
The cells have thus the office of locks in a canal, which
cause the shallow stream to deepen at particular places.
I do not regard this interpretation as satisfactory; but
the fact at any rate seems to prove that so far from the
cells manifesting greater instability than the fibres, they
manifest less.</p>

<p>135. The hypothesis of nerve-force being developed in
the ganglia, gradually assumed a more precise expression
when the nerve-cells were regarded as the only important
elements of a ganglion. It has become the foundation-stone
of Neurology, therefore very particular care should
be taken to make sure that this foundation rests on clear
and indisputable evidence. Instead of that, there is absolutely
no evidence on which it can rest; and there is
much evidence decidedly opposed to it. Neither structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
nor experiment points out the cells as the chief
agents in neural processes. Let us consider these.</p>

<p><a href="#ifig_22">Fig. 22</a> shows the contents of a molluscan ganglion
which has been teased out with needles.</p>

(after Bucholtz).</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
The cells are seen to vary in size, but in all there is a
rim of neuroplasm surrounding the
large nucleus, and from this neuroplasm
the fibre is seen to be a prolongation.
The dotted substance in
the centre is the neuroglia. Except
in the possession of a nucleus, there
is obviously here no essential difference
in the structure of cell and fibre.</p>

<div id="ifig_23" class="figright" style="max-width: 12em;">

<p>Fig. 23—<i>Fibres from the
auditory nerve.</i> <i>a</i>, the axis
cylinder; <i>b</i>, the cellular enlargement;
<i>c</i>, the medullary
sheath.</p></div></div>

<p>Now compare this with <a href="#ifig_23">Fig. 23</a>, representing
three fibres from the auditory
nerve.</p>

<p>Here the cell substance, as Max
Schultze remarks, “is a continuation
of the axis cylinder, and encloses the
nucleus. The medulla commonly ceases
at the point where the axis enters the
cell, to reappear at its exit; but it
sometimes stretches across the cell to
enclose it also: so that such a ganglion
cell is in truth simply the nucleated
portion of the cylinder axis.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
There are many places in which fibres
are thus found with cells inserted in
their course as swellings: in the spinal
ganglia of fishes these are called bipolar
cells; they are sometimes met
with even in the cerebellum; but
oftener in peripheral nerves, where
they are mostly small masses of granular
neuroplasm from which usually
a branching of the fibre takes place.
The point to which attention is called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
is that in some cases, if not in all, the nerve-fibre is
structurally continuous with the cell contents. The
two organites—fibre and cell—differ only as regards
the nucleus and pigment. Haeckel, who affirms that
in the crayfish (<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>) he never saw a cell
which did not continue as a fibre, thinks there is always
a marked separation of the granular substance
from its “hyaline protoplasm,” and that only this latter
forms the axis cylinder. But although my observations
agree with this as a general fact, I have seen even in
crayfish the granular substance prolonged into the axis
cylinder; and in other animals the granular substance
is frequently discernible.</p>

<p>Indeed it may be said that anatomists are now tolerably
unanimous as to the axis cylinder being identical
with the protoplasmic cell substance. If this be so, we
have only to recall the principle of identity of property
accompanying identity of structure, to conclude that
<i>whatever properties we assign to the cells</i> (unless we restrict
these to the nucleus and pigment) <i>we must assign to the
axis cylinders</i>. We can therefore no longer entertain the
hypothesis of the cells being the fountains or reservoirs
of Neurility; the less so when we reflect that cells do
not form the hundredth part of nerve-tissue: for even the
gray substance bears but a small proportion to the white;
and of the gray substance, Henle estimates that one half
is fibrous, the rest is partly cellular, partly amorphous.
Those who derive Neurility from the cells, forget that
although the organism begins as a cell, and for some
weeks consists mainly of cells, yet from this time onwards
there is an ever-increasing preponderance of cell-derivatives—fibres,
tubes, and amorphous substance—and corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
with this is the ever-increasing power and
complexity of the organism.</p>

<p>136. From another point of view we must reject the
hypothesis. Not only does the evidence which points
to the essential continuity in structure of nerve cell and
fibre discredit the notion of their physiological diversity,
but it is further supported by the fact that although the
whole nervous system is structurally continuous, an immense
mass of nerve-fibres have no <i>immediate</i> connection
with ganglionic cells:—neither springing from nor terminating
in such cells, their activity cannot be assigned
to them. To many readers this statement will be startling.
They have been so accustomed to hear that every
fibre begins or terminates in a cell, that a doubt thrown
on it will sound paradoxical. But there is an equivoque
here which must be got rid of. When it is said that
every fibre has its “origin” in a cell, this may be true
if origin mean its <i>point of departure in evolution</i>, for
“cells” are the early forms of all organites; but although
every organite is at first a cell, and in this sense a nerve-fibre
must be said to originate in a cell, we must guard
against the equivoque which arises from calling the
highly differentiated organite, usually designated ganglionic
cell, by the same name as its starting-point. On
this ground I suggest the term neuroblast, in lieu of
nerve-cell, for the earlier stages in the evolution of cell
and fibre. Both Embryology and Anatomy seem to show
that cell and fibre are organites differentiated from identical
neuroblasts, with a somewhat varying history, so
that in their final stages the cell and fibre have conspicuous
differences in form with an underlying identity;
just as a male and female organism starting from identical
ova, and having essential characters in common, are
yet in other characters conspicuously unlike. The multipolar
cell is not necessarily the origin of a nerve-fibre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
although it is probable that some short fibres have their
origin in the prolongations of cells. Although the latter
point has not, I think, been satisfactorily established,
except in the invertebrata, I see no reason whatever to
doubt its probability; what seems the least reconcilable
with the evidence is the notion that all fibres arise as
prolongations from ganglionic cells, instead of arising
independently as differentiations from neuroblasts. The
reader will observe that my objection to the current view
is purely anatomical; for the current view would suit my
physiological interpretations equally well, and would be
equally irreconcilable with the hypothesis of the cell as
the source of Neurility, so long as the identity of structure
in the axis cylinder and cell contents is undisputed.</p>

<p>137. The evidence at present stands thus: There are
numerous multipolar cells which have no traceable connection
with nerve-fibres; and fibres which have no
direct connection with multipolar cells. By the first I
do not mean the disputed apolar cells, I mean cells in
the gray substance of the centres which send off processes
that subdivide and terminate as fibrils in the network
of the Neuroglia (Figs. 16, 18). It is indeed generally
assumed that these have each one process—the
axis-cylinder process—which is prolonged as a nerve-fibre;
nor would it be prudent to assert that such is
never the case; though it would be difficult to distinguish
between a fibre which had united with a process
and a fibre which was a prolongation of a process, in both
cases the neuroplasm being identical. I only urge that
the assumption is grounded not on anatomical evidence,
but on a supposed necessary postulate. All that can be
demonstrated is that some processes terminate in excessively
fine fibrils; and occasionally in thousands of specimens
processes have been traced into dark-bordered fibres.
It is true that they often present appearances which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
have led to the inference that they did so terminate—appearances
so deceptive that Golgi and Arndt independently
record observations of unbranched processes
having the aspect of axis cylinders being prolonged to
a considerable distance (600 μ in one case), yet these
were found to terminate <i>not</i> in a dark-bordered fibre, but
in a network of fibrils.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>138. While it is thus doubtful whether dark-bordered
fibres are always immediately connected with cells, it
is demonstrable that multitudes of fibres have only an
indirect connection with cells, being developed as outgrowths
from other fibres. Dr. Beale considers that in
each such outgrowths have their origin in small neuroplasmic
masses (his “germinal matter”). That is another
question. The fact here to be insisted on is that
we often find groups of cells with only two or three fibres,
and groups of fibres where very few cells exist. Schröder
van der Kolk says that in a sturgeon (<i>Accipenser sturio</i>)
weighing 120 pounds he found the spinal cord scarcely
thicker than that of a frog; the muscles of this fish are
enormous, and its motor nerves abundant; yet these
nerves entered the cord by roots no thicker than a pig’s
bristle; and in the very little gray matter of the cord
there was only a cell here and there found after long
search. Are we to suppose that these rare cells were the
origins of all the motor and sensory nerves? A similar
want of correspondence may be noticed elsewhere. Thus
in the spinal cord of the Lamprey my preparations show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
very few cells in any of the sections, and numerous sections
show none at all. Stieda counted only eight to
ten cells in each horn of some osseous fishes, except at
the places where the spinal roots emerged. In the eel
and cod he found parts of the cord quite free from cells,
and in other parts found two, three, never more than ten.
In birds he counted from twenty-five to thirty. Particular
attention is called to this fact of the eel’s cord
being thus deficient, because every one knows the energetic
reflex action of that cord, each separate segment of
which responds to peripheral stimulation.</p>

<p>It may indeed be urged that these few cells were the
origin of all the fibres, the latter having multiplied by
the well-known process of subdivision; and in support
of this view the fact may be cited of the colossal fibres
of the electric fishes, each of which divides into five-and-twenty
fibres, and in the electric eel each fibre is said by
Max Schultze to divide into a million of fibrils. But I
interpret this fact otherwise. It seems to me to prove
nothing more than that the neuroplasm has differentiated
into few cells and many fibres. And my opinion is
grounded on the evidence of Development, presently to
be adduced. If we find (and this we do find) fibres
making their appearance anywhere <i>before</i> multipolar cells
appear, the question is settled.</p>

<p>139. Dr. Beale regards the large caudate cells of the
centres as different organites from the oval and pyriform
cells, and thinks they are probably stations through which
fibres having different origins merely pass, and change
their directions; and Max Schultze says that no single
fibril has been found to have a central origin; every
fibril arises at the periphery, and passes through a cell,
which is thus crossed by different fibrils.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> (Comp. <a href="#ifig_17">Fig. 17</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
The teaching of Development is on this point of supreme
importance. Unhappily there has not yet been a
sufficient collection of systematic observations to enable
us to speak very confidently as to the successive stages,
but some negative evidence there is. The changes take
place with great rapidity, and the earliest stages have
hardly been observed at all. Although for several successive
years I watched the development of tadpoles, the
difficulties were so great, and the appearances so perplexing,
that the only benefit I derived was that of being able
the better to understand the more successful investigations
of others. Four or five days after fecundation is the
earliest period of which I have any recorded observation;
at this period the cerebral substance appeared as a finely
granular matter, having numerous lines of segmentation
marking it off into somewhat spherical and oval masses,
interspersed with large granules and fat globules. Here
and there hyaline substance appeared between the segments.
Similar observations have since been recorded by
Charles Robin in the earliest stages of the Triton.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> He
says that when the external gills presented their first
indications, nuclei appeared, each surrounded by a rim of
hyaline substance, from which a pale filament was prolonged
at one end, sometimes one at both ends, and this
filament subdivided as it grew in length until it had all
the appearance of an axis cylinder. This, however, he
says, is a striation, not a fibrillation; he refuses to admit
that the axis cylinder is a bundle of fibrils. He further
notices the simultaneous appearance of amorphous substance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
and as this is several days before there is any
trace of a <i>pia mater</i>, or proper connective tissue, he urges
this among the many considerations which should prevent
the identification of neuroglia with connective tissue.</p>

<p>In a very young embryo of a mole (I could not determine
its age) the cortex of the hemispheres showed
granular amorphous substance, in which were embedded
spherical masses of somewhat paler color, which had no
nuclei, and were therefore not cells. Besides these, there
were nucleated masses (apolar cells, therefore) and more
developed cells, unipolar, bipolar, and tripolar. Not a
trace of a nerve-fibre was visible. In agreement with this
are the observations of Masius and Van Lair, who cut out
a portion of the spinal cord in a frog, and observed the
regenerated tissue after the lapse of a month. It contained
apolar, bipolar, and multipolar cells, together with
“corpuscles without processes, for the most part larger
than the cells, and appearing to be mere agglomerations
of granules,”—these latter I suppose to have been what
I describe as segmentations of the undeveloped substance.
Gray fibres, with a few varicose fibres, also
appeared.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p id="II_140">140. The admirable investigations of Franz Boll have
given these observations a new significance. He finds in
the cerebral substance of the chick on the third or fourth
day of incubation a well-marked separation between the
neuroglia and nerve-tissue proper. <a href="#ifig_24">Fig. 24, A</a>, represents
three nerve-cells, each with its nucleus and nucleolus, and
each surrounded with its layer of neuroplasm. The other
four masses he regards as nuclei of connective tissue.
Three days later the distinction between the two is more
marked (<a href="#ifig_24">Fig. 24, B</a>). Not only have the nerve-cells acquired
an increase of neuroplasm, they also present indications
of their future processes, which at the twelfth day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
are varicose (<a href="#ifig_24">Fig. 24, C</a>). (All this while the connective
corpuscles remain unchanged.) Although Boll was unable
to trace one of these processes into nerve-fibres, he has
little doubt that they do ultimately become (unite with?)
axis cylinders.</p>

<p>It is difficult to reconcile such observations with the
hypothesis of the cells being simply points of <i>reunion of
fibrils</i>. We see here multipolar cells before any fibrils
appear. Respecting the development of the white substance,
i. e. the nerve-fibres, Boll remarks that in the
<i>corpus callosum</i> of the chick the first differentiation resembles
that of the gray substance.</p>

<p>The polygonal and spindle-shaped cells represented in
<a href="#ifig_25">Fig. 25, A</a>, are respectively starting-points of connective
and neural tissues. The spindle-shaped cells elongate,
and rapidly become bipolar. This is supposed to result
in the whole cell becoming transformed into a fibre, the
nucleus and nucleolus vanishing; but the transformation
is so rapid that he confesses that he was unable to trace
its stages; all that can positively be asserted is that one
or two days after the appearance presented in <a href="#ifig_25">Fig. 25, B</a>,
the aspect changes to that of fibrils. The columns of
polygonal cells between which run these fibrils, he regards
as the connective corpuscles described by several
anatomists in the white substance both of brain and cord,
and which are sometimes declared to be multipolar nerve-cells.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>141. Dr. Schmidt’s observations on the human embryo
were of course on tissue at a very much later stage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
According to him, the fibrils of the axis cylinders are
formed by the linear disposition and consolidation of
elementary granules. The fibrils thus formed are separated
by interfibrillar granules which in time become fibrils.
Not earlier than three months and a half does the formation
of individual axis cylinders begin by the aggregation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
of these fibrils into minute bundles, which are subsequently
surrounded by a delicate sheath.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>142. With respect to the transition of the spindle-shaped
cells into fibrils, since there is a gap in the observations
of Boll, and since those of Schmidt are subsequent
to the disappearance of the cells, and in both cases all
trace of nucleus has disappeared, I suggest that we have
here an analogy with what Weismann has recorded of the
metamorphoses of insects. In the very remarkable memoir
of that investigator<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> it is shown that the metamorphoses
do not take place by a gradual modification of the
existing organs and tissues, but by a <i>resolution</i> of these
into their elements, and a <i>reconstruction</i> of their elements
into tissues and organs. The muscles, nerves, tracheæ, and
alimentary canal, undergo what may be called a fatty
degeneration, and pass thence into a mere blastema. <i>It
is out of these ruins of the old tissues that the new tissues
are reconstructed.</i> On the fourth day the body of the
pupa is filled with a fluid mass—a plasma composed of
blood and dissolved tissues. The subsequent development
is thus in all essential respects a repetition of that
which originally took place in the ovum.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Two points are especially noticeable: First, that in this
resolved mass of granules and fat globules there quickly
appear large globular masses which develop a fine membrane,
and subsequently nuclei. A glance at the figure
51 of Weismann’s plates reveals the close resemblance to
the earliest stages of nerve-cells; and the whole process
recalls the regeneration of nerves and nerve-centres after
their fatty degeneration.</p>

<p>Secondly, the nerves reappear in their proper places in
the new muscles, and this at a time when the nerve-centres
are still unformed; so that the <i>whole peripheral system
is completely rebuilt in absolute independence of the
central system</i>. The idea, therefore, that nerve-fibres are
the products of ganglia must be relinquished. This idea
is further discountenanced by Boll’s observations, which
show that the fibre-cells are from the first different from
the ganglionic cells; and by the observations of Foster
and Balfour, that “fibres are present in the white substance
on the third day of incubation”; <i>whereas cell processes
do not appear until the eighth day</i>. Foster and Balfour
are inclined to believe “that even on the seventh
day it is not possible to trace any connection between the
cells and fibres.” In the later stages, the connection is
perhaps established.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
143. We may, I think, conclude from all this that in
the higher vertebrates the white substance of brain and
cord is not the direct product of the gray substance; in
other words, that here nerve-fibres, even if subsequently
in connection with the ganglionic cells, have an independent
origin. They may grow towards and blend with
cell processes; they are not prolongations of those processes.
They may be identical in structure and property,
as one muscle is identical with another, but one is not
the parent of the other.</p>

<p>144. Sigmund Mayer emphatically declares that in no
instance has he traced a cell process developed into a
dark-bordered nerve-fibre. The process, he says, may
often be traced for a certain distance alongside of a fibre;
but it then suddenly ceases, whereas the fibre is seen continuing
its course unaltered. Still more conclusive is the
evidence afforded by nerves having only very few fibres
(2–4 sometimes in the frog), which have, nevertheless,
a liberal supply of cells, visible without preparation.
Valentin counted twenty-four cells in a nerve which
had but two fibres.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Now although it is possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
explain the presence of numerous fibres with rare cells
either as due to subdivisions of fibres, or to the fibres
having cells elsewhere for their origin, it is not thus that
we can explain the presence of numerous cells which
have no fibres developed from their processes.</p>

<p id="II_145">145. With regard to this observation of the cell process
running alongside of the fibre, the recent researches
of Ranvier may throw some light on it. He describes
the cells in the spinal ganglia as all unipolar; each single
process pursues a more or less winding course as a fibril,
often blending with others, till it reaches one of the
fibres from the sensory root. It blends with this fibre
at the annular constriction of the fibre, becoming here
incorporated with it, so that a T-shaped fibre is the result.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
If this should be confirmed, it would reconcile
many observations; but it would greatly disturb all current
interpretations. Ranvier remarks that it is no longer
tenable to suppose that the ganglionic cell is a centre,
sensory or motor, receiving the excitation or sending
forth a motor impulse; for if the fibril issuing from a
cell becomes laterally soldered to a nerve-fibre, there
is no possibility of saying in which direction this cell
receives the excitation, nor in which it transmits the
impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
146. We have seen good reason to conclude that the
essential element of the nerve—the axis cylinder—is
the same substance as the neuroplasm which forms the
essential element of the cell. At any rate, we are quite
certain that the cell process is neuroplasm. On this
ground there is no difficulty in understanding that a cell
process may sometimes be drawn out into an axis cylinder
(as indeed we see to be the case in the invertebrata
and electric fishes); while again in numerous other cases
the nerve-fibre has an independent origin, being, in short,
a differentiation from the neuroplasm which has become a
fibre instead of a cell. It is clear from the observations
of Rouget on Development, and of Sigmund Mayer on
Regeneration, that fibres, nuclei, and cells become differentiated
from the same neuroplasm, those portions which
are not converted into fibres remaining first as lumps of
neuroplasm, then acquiring a nucleus, and some of these
passing into cells. I mean that between fibres, nuclei,
and cells there are only morphological differences in an
identical neuroplasm.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> If this is in any degree true,
it will not only explain how fresh fibres may be developed
in the course of fibres, branching from them as
from trunks, and branchlets from branchlets, twigs from
branchlets, the same conditions of growth being present
throughout; it will also completely modify the notion
of any physiological distinction between cell and fibre
greater than can be assigned to the morphological differences.
We shall then no longer suppose that the cell is
the fountain whence the fibre draws its nutrition and its
“force”; and this will be equally the case even if we
admit that a cell is, so to speak, the germ from which
a whole plexus of fibres was evolved, for no one will
pretend that the “force” of an organism is directly derived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
from the ovum, or that the ovum nourishes the
organism.</p>

<p>147. At this stage of the discussion it is needful to
consider a point which will spontaneously occur to every
instructed reader, I mean the interesting fact discovered
by Dr. Waller, that when a sensory root was divided, the
portion which was still in connection with the ganglion
remained unaltered, whereas the portion which was only
in connection with the spinal cord degenerated; and <i>vice
versa</i>, when a motor root was divided, the portion connected
with the cord remained unaltered, the portion
severed from the cord degenerated. The observation has
been frequently confirmed, and the conclusion drawn has
been that the cells in the ganglion of the posterior root
are the nutritive centres of posterior nerves, the cells in
the anterior horn of the cord being the nutritive centres
of the anterior nerves. Another interpretation is however
needed, the more so because the fact is not constant.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
True of some nerves, it is not true of others. Vulpian
found that when he cut out a portion of the lingual
nerve, and transplanted it by grafting under the skin of
the groin, where of course it was entirely removed from
all ganglionic influence, it degenerated, but it also regenerated.
Pathological observations convinced Meissner
that the ganglia are wholly destitute of an influence on
the nutrition of the vagus; and Schiff proved experimentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
that other ganglia were equally inoperative,
since motor nerves could be separated from the spinal
cord without degeneration.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Not however to insist on
this, nor on the other facts of regeneration, in the absence
of ganglionic influence, let us remark that Dr. Waller’s
examples would not be conclusive unless the teaching of
Embryology could be disproved. That nerves degenerate
when separated from ganglia is a fact; but it is also a
fact that muscles degenerate when separated from a
nerve-centre; yet we do not suppose the nerve-centre
to nourish the muscles. And against the fact that the
sensory nerve remains unaltered only in that portion
which is connected with the ganglion, we must oppose
the observations of Kölliker and Schwalbe,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> who affirm
that none of the fibres which enter the posterior columns
of the spinal cord have any direct connection with the
cells of the ganglion on the posterior root. The cells of
this ganglion they declare to be unipolar (in the higher
vertebrates), and the fibres in connection with these cells
are not those which pass to the cord, but all of them pass
to the periphery. According to Ranvier, the fibres from
the cells join the fibres of the posterior root. Schwalbe
found that if the spinal nerve be firmly grasped and
<i>steadily</i> drawn, it will often be pulled from its sheath,
and the ganglion laid bare;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> in this ganglion all the cells
are found undisturbed, which could not be the case had
fibres from <i>those</i> cells entered the cord, since the traction
would necessarily have disturbed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_21">RECAPITULATION.</h3>

<p>148. At the opening of this chapter mention was made
of the besetting sin of the analytical tendency, namely,
to disregard the elements which provisionally had been
set aside, and not restore them in the reconstruction of
a synthetical explanation. Familiar experiences tell us
that a stimulus applied to the skin is followed by a muscular
movement, or a glandular secretion; sometimes this
takes place without any conscious sensation; sometimes
we are distinctly conscious of the stimulus; and sometimes
we consciously will the movement. These facts the
physiologist tries to unravel, and to trace the complicated
processes involved. The neurologist of course confines
himself exclusively to the neural processes; all the other
processes are provisionally left out of account. But
not only so: the analytical tendency is carried further,
and even in the neural process the <i>organs</i> are neglected
for the sake of the nervous <i>tissue</i>, and the nervous tissue
for the sake of the <i>nerve-cell</i>. The consequence has
been that we have an explanation offered us which runs
<span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p>149. The nerve-cell is the supreme element, the origin
of the nerve-fibre, and the fountain of nerve-force. The
cells are connected one with another by means of fibres,
and with muscles, glands, and centres also by means of
fibres, which are merely channels for the nerve-force. A
stimulus at the surface is carried by a sensory fibre to a cell
in the centre; from that point it is carried by another
fibre to another cell; and from that by a third fibre to a
muscle: a reflex contraction results. This is the elementary
“nervous arc.” But this arc has also higher arcs
with which it is in connection: the sensory cell besides
sending a fibre directly to a motor cell, also sends one
upwards to the cerebral centres; and here again there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
a nervous arc, so that the cerebral centre sends down
an impulse on the motor cells, and the contraction which
results is due to a volitional impulse. The transmission
of the stimulation which in the first case was purely
physical, becomes in the latter case psychical. The sensory
impression is in one cell transformed into a <i>sensation</i>,
in another cell into an <i>idea</i>, in a third cell into a
<i>volition</i>.</p>

<p>150. This course is described with a precision and a
confidence which induces the inexperienced reader to suppose
that it is the transcript of actual observation. I
venture to say that it is imaginary from beginning to end.
I do not affirm that no such course is pursued, I only say
no such course was ever demonstrated, but that at every
stage the requisite facts of observation are either incomplete
or contradictory. First, be it noted that the actions
to be explained are never the actions of organs so simple
as the description sets forth. It is not by single fibres
and cells that the stimulus is effected, but by complex
nerves and complex centres. Only by a diagrammatic
artifice can the fibre represent the nerve, and the cell the
centre. In reality the cells of the centre (supposing them
to be the <i>only</i> agents) act in groups, and Anatomy should
therefore show them to be mutually united in groups—which
is what no Anatomy has succeeded in showing,
unless the Neuroglia be called upon. Secondly, be it
noted that the current scheme of the relations between
cells and fibres is one founded on physiological postulates,
not on observation. Thirdly, much of what is actually
observed is very doubtful, because we do not know
whether the appearances are normal, or due to modes
of preparation and post-mortem changes. We cannot at
present say, for instance, whether the fibrillated appearance
of cell contents and axis cylinder represents the living
structure or not. We may either suppose that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
neuroplasmic pulp splits longitudinally into fibres, or that
neuroplasmic threads resolve themselves into a homogeneous
pulp—the axis cylinder may be a condensation
of many fibrils, or the fibrils may be a resolution of the
substance.</p>

<p>151. Let us contrast step by step the Imaginary Anatomy
found in the text-books with the Objective Anatomy
as at present disclosed by the researches of all the chief
workers. Imaginary Anatomy assumes that the sensory
fibre passes from a surface into the cells of the posterior
horn of the spinal cord. Objective Anatomy sees the
fibre pass into the gray substance, but declares that no
direct entrance of a fibre into a cell is there visible.</p>

<p>Imaginary Anatomy assumes that from the sensory
cells of the gray substance pass fibres in connection with
the motor cells of the anterior horn, thus forming a direct
channel through which the excitation of a sensory cell is
transmitted to a motor cell. Objective Anatomy fails
to discover any such direct channel—no such fibres are
demonstrable.</p>

<p>Imaginary Anatomy assumes that from the motor cells
issue fibres which descend to the muscles and glands, and
carry there the motor impulses and the “mandates of the
will.” Objective Anatomy fails to find at the utmost
more than a probability that these cells are continued as
fibres, a probability which is founded on the rare facts
of cell processes having been seen extending into the
roots of the nerves, and of a cell process having occasionally
been seen elsewhere continuous with a dark-bordered
fibre. Granting, however, that this probability
represents the fact, we have thus only one part of the
“nervous arc” which can be said to have been verified.</p>

<p>Imaginary Anatomy further assumes that this nervous
arc is connected with cerebral centres by means of fibres
going upwards from the posterior cells, and fibres descending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
downwards to the anterior cells. Objective Anatomy
sees nothing of the kind. It sees fibres entering the gray
substance, and there lost to view in a mass of granular
substance, fibrils, neuroblasts, and cells. There <i>may be</i>
uninterrupted fibres passing upwards and downwards;
but it is impossible to see them. And if we are told that
physiological interpretations demand such a structure,
we may fairly ask if this, and this only, is the structure
which is adequate to the propagation of excitation?
Now it seems to me that another kind of structure, and
one more closely agreeing with what is observed, better
answers the demands of Physiology. This will be more
evident after the Laws of Nervous Action have been expounded
in the succeeding chapter. Meanwhile we may
remark that the arrangement of cells and fibres which is
imagined as the mechanism of propagation and reflexion
is absolutely irreconcilable with the teaching of Experiment:
for the spinal cord may be cut through anywhere,
without destruction of the transmission of sensory and
motor excitations, provided only a small portion of gray
substance be left to establish the continuity of the axis.
Divide all the substance of the posterior half in one
place, and all the substance of the anterior half in another,
yet so long as there is a portion of gray substance
left as a bridge between the lower and upper segments,
the transmission of sensory and motor excitations will
take place.</p>

<p>152. In other essential respects we have to note that
the anatomical evidence for the current interpretations is
absolutely deficient or contradictory. There is no adequate
warrant for the assumption that all nerves have
their origin in ganglia, all fibres in cells. Such evidence
as at present exists is against that supposition, and in
favor of the supposition that both cell and fibre are differentiations
of a common neuroplasm, sometimes directly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
sometimes indirectly continuous. Fibres, and plexuses of
fibres, interspersed with cells irregularly distributed—now
singly, now in small groups, now in larger and
larger groups—constitute the <i>figured</i> elements of nerve-tissue;
and even if we set aside the <i>amorphous</i> substance
as indifferent or subordinate, we have still no ground for
assigning the supremacy, much less the sole significance,
to the cells. The grounds of this denial have been amply
furnished in our exposition. For, let it be granted that
nerve-cells are the origins of the fibres and the sources of
their nutrition—a point which is eminently disputable—this
would in no sense help the physiological hypothesis
of the cell as the fountain of Neurility. If the fibre is
simply the cell-contents drawn out longitudinally, if its
essential element is identical with the essential element
of the cell, then we can no more ascribe to the cell the
exclusive property of Neurility than we can draw a lump
of lead out into a wire, and then ascribe different properties
to the thin end and the thick end. But on this
point it is needless to speculate, since we have experimental
evidence proving that the nerve-fibre has its Neurility
even when separated from the cell, or even from the
ganglion.</p>

<p>153. It is possible—I do not see sufficient evidence
for a stronger assertion—that the cells are the nutritive
sources of the fibres. They may represent the alimental
rather than the instrumental activities of nervous
life. (Compare <span class="smcap">Problem I.</span> § <a href="#I_42">42</a>.) My contention is
that in any case they are not the supreme elements of
the active tissue, and in no sense can they be considered
as <i>organs</i>. Only confusion of ideas could for a moment
permit such language, or could assign central functions to
cells which are elements of tissue. If the cell be credited
with such powers anywhere, it must be credited with
them everywhere. Now I ask what conceivable central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
function can be ascribed to a cell which terminates the
fibre in a peripheral ganglion, or which is merely an enlargement
in the course of a fibre in a nerve-bundle?
Besides the facts already adduced, let attention be called
to this: If a nerve-bundle from the <i>submucosa</i> of the intestine
be examined, there appear among the fibres many
nuclei (neuroblasts), and occasionally cells, unipolar and
bipolar. These cells—if we may trust the observations
of Rouget on the earliest development of nerves, and of
Sigmund Mayer on regenerated nerves—are simply more
advanced stages of evolution of the neuroblasts; but whatever
their genesis may be, there can be nothing in the
nature of a central function assigned to them.</p>

<p>154. It may be asked, What part can we assign to
cells in neural actions if they are apolar, unipolar, and
even when multipolar, isolated from each other, and from
fibres? I confess that I have no answer ready, not even
an hypothesis. Until some rational interpretation of the
cell be given we must be content to hold an answer in
suspense. What I would urge is that we are precipitate
in assuming that the anatomical connection between one
element and another must necessarily be that of a fibre.
In a semi-fluid substance, such as neurine, continuity may
be perfect without solid fibres: the amorphous substance
and the plasmode may as well transmit waves of molecular
motion from one part of the tissue to another, and
therefore from cell to cell, or from cell to fibre, as a
figured substance may. When the posterior root enters
the gray substance of the cord, there is no more necessity
for its fibres passing directly into the cells of that gray substance,
in order to excite their activity, than there is for a
wire to pass from the bell to the ear of the servant, who
hears the vibrations of the bell through the pulsations of
the intervening air upon her tympanum. Look at the
structure of the retina, or the cerebellum, and you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
find that the ganglionic cells which have processes passing
in a direction contrary to that whence the stimulus
arrives, have none where continuity of fibre and cell
would be indispensable on the current hypothesis. Light
stimulates the rods and cones, but there are no nerve-fibres,
hitherto discovered, passing from these to the ganglionic
cells; instead of that there is a ground-substance
thickly interspersed with granules and nuclei. <i>From</i> the
cells we see processes issue; <i>to</i> the cells none are seen
arriving. So with the cerebellum. The large cells send
their processes upwards to the surface; but downwards
towards the white substance the processes are lost in the
granular layer, which most histologists regard as connective
tissue.</p>

<p>155. A mere glance at nervous tissue in any part will
show that cells are far from forming the principal constituents.
In the epidermis or a gland the cell is obviously
the chief element, forming the bulk of the tissue, and
being the characteristic agent. In nerve-tissue, as in
connective tissue, the reverse is the case. We must
therefore cease to regard the cell as having the importance
now attached to it, and must rather throw the
emphasis on the fibres and neuroglia.</p>

<p>156. Before quitting this subject let a word be said on
the amazing classification which has attained wide acceptance
(although rejected by the most eminent authorities),
founded on the size of the cells—the large multipolar
cells being specified as motor, the smaller cells as sensory,
while those of an intermediate size are sympathetic. I
forbear to dwell on the development of this notion which
specifies sensational, ideational, and emotional cells, because
this does not pretend to have a basis in observation;
whereas there are anatomical facts which give a certain
superficial plausibility to the original classification. The
conception is profoundly unphysiological; yet, if the anatomical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
evidence were constant, one might give it another
interpretation. The evidence is, however, not constant.
Large cells are found in regions assigned to sensory nerves,
and small cells in motor regions. In the spinal cord of
the tortoise Stieda declares that the so-called motor cells
are limited to the cervical and lumbar enlargements; all
the rest of the motor region being absolutely destitute of
them.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Again look at the cells of the retina—no one
will assign motor functions to them—yet they are the
same as those of the cerebellum and the anterior horns of
the spinal cord. (It is worth a passing mention that the
structure of the nervous parts of the retina more closely
resembles that of the cerebellum than of the cerebrum.)</p>

<p>157. While our knowledge of the cell is thus far indeed
from having the precision which the text-books display,
and in no sense warrants the current physiological interpretations,
our knowledge of fibres and neuroglia is also
too incomplete for theoretic purposes. We know that
the axis cylinder is the essential element; but we are
still at a loss what part is to be assigned to the medullary
sheath. There is indeed a popular hypothesis which pronounces
it to be the means of <i>insulating</i> the fibre, and
thus preserving the isolated conduction of nerve-force.
Being of a fatty nature, this insulating office was readily
suggested in agreement with the assumption that Neurility
was Electricity. Now, without discussing whether
Neurility is or is not Electricity, even admitting the
former to be satisfactorily proved, I must remark that the
admission still leaves the medullary sheath incapable of
fulfilling the supposed office, since not only is there no
such sheath in most of the invertebrates and in the sympathetic
nerves of vertebrates, but even in those nerves
which have the sheath it is precisely in places where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
insulation would be most needed—namely, just before
the terminations of the fibres in muscles and in centres—that
the sheath is <i>absent</i>. This is as if we tried to conduct
water through a pipe which fell short at both ends—before
it left the cistern, and before it reached the spot to
be watered. If there is a tendency in Neurility to spread
wherever it is not insulated by a medullary sheath, then
before reaching the centres and the muscles, it must, on
the insulating hypothesis, dribble away!</p>

<p>158. The facts expressed in the “law of isolated conduction”
are important, and are difficult of explanation;
but it is obvious that they cannot be referred to the presence
of the medullary sheath. Nor indeed will any insight
into the propagation of stimulation through the
central axis be intelligible until we have reformed our
anatomical theories, and taken the Neuroglia into account.
The theory which connects every fibre directly with a cell,
and every cell with another by anastomosis—even were
it demonstrated—would not explain the law of isolated
conduction. Butzke cogently remarks<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> that such a disposition
of the elements should render all neural paths
invariable; whereas the fact is that they are very variable.
We learn to perform actions, and then we unlearn
them; the paths are traversed now in one direction, now
in another. Fluctuation is the characteristic of central
combinations. And for this fluctuating combination of
elements a corresponding diversity is required in the possible
channels. This seems to be furnished by the network
of the Neuroglia. See the representation copied
from Butzke’s plate, and note how the cell-process blends
with the meshes of the Neuroglia. Is it fanciful to regard
this network of fibrils as having somewhat the relation of
capillaries to blood-vessels? Did we not experimentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
know that the capillaries are terminal blood-vessels, we
should not suspect it from mere examination of the
structure.</p>

<p>159. Having insisted that our knowledge is insufficient
for any explanation of the “law of isolated conduction,” I
can only suggest a path of research which may lead to
some result. What we know is that some stimulations
are propagated from one end of the cerebro-spinal axis to
the other in definitely <i>restricted</i> paths, while others are
<i>irradiated</i> along many paths. In the succeeding chapter
this will be more fully considered; what we have here to
note is that the manifold irradiations of a stimulation
have an anatomical substratum in the manifold sub-divisions
of the network of fibrils and the amorphous
substance in which they penetrate.</p>

<p>160. In conclusion, I would say, let no one place a too
great confidence in the reigning doctrines respecting the
elementary structure of the nervous system, but accept
every statement as a “working hypothesis” which has
its value in so far as it links together verified facts, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
suggests new research, but is wholly without value in so
far as it is made a basis of deductions not otherwise
verified. Hypotheses are indispensable to research, but
they must be accompanied by vigilant scepticism. Imagination
is only an enemy to Science when Scepticism is
asleep.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAWS OF NERVOUS ACTIVITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>161. <span class="firstword">The</span> foregoing remarks have had the object of
showing how little substantial aid Psychology can at
present derive from what is known of the elementary
structure of the nervous system, indispensable as an accurate
knowledge of that structure must be to a complete
analysis of its functions. This caution has been
specially addressed to those medical and psychological
students whose researches leave them insufficient leisure
to pursue microscopical investigations for themselves, and
who are therefore forced to rely on second-hand knowledge,
which is usually defective in the many qualifying
considerations which keep scepticism vigilant. Relying
on positive statements, and delusive diagrams which
only display what the observer <i>imagines</i>, not what he
actually <i>sees</i>, they construct on such data theories of disease,
or of mental processes; or else they translate observed
facts into the terms of this imaginary anatomy,
and offer the translation as a new contribution to Science.</p>

<p>162. But little aid as can at present be derived from
the teaching of the microscope, some aid Psychology may
even now derive from it. The teaching will often serve,
for instance, to correct the precipitate conclusions of
subjective analysis, which present artificial distinctions
as real distinctions, separating what Nature has united.
It will show certain organic connections not previously
suspected; and since whatever is organically connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
cannot functionally be separated, such sharply marked
analytical distinctions as those of periphery and centre,
or of sensation and motion, must be only regarded as
artificial aids. The demonstration of the indissoluble
union of the tissues is a demonstration of their functional
co-operation. So also the anatomical demonstration of
the similarity and continuity of all parts of the central
system sets aside the analytical separation of one centre
from another, except as a convenient artifice; proving
that cerebral substance is one with spinal substance,
having the same properties, the same laws of action.</p>

<p>For the present, Psychology must seek objective aid
from Physiology and Pathology rather than from elementary
Anatomy. In the paragraphs which are to follow
I shall endeavor to select the chief laws of nervous
activity which the researches of physiologists and pathologists
disclose. By these laws we may direct and control
psychological research.</p>

<h3 id="sec_22">THE ENERGY OF NEURILITY.</h3>

<p>163. Vitality is characterized by incessant molecular
movement, both of composition and decomposition, in
the building up of structure and the liberation of energy.
The life of every organism is a complex of changes, each
of which directly or indirectly affects the statical and
dynamical relations, each being the resultant of many
co-operant forces. In the nourishment of every organite
there is an accumulation of molecular <i>tension</i>, that is
to say, stored-up energy in a latent state, ready to be
expended in the activity of that organite; and this expenditure
may take place in a steady flow, or in a sudden
gush. The molecular movements under one aspect
may be called convergent, or <i>formative</i>: they build the
structure, and tend to the state of equilibrium which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
we call the statical condition of the organite, i. e. the
condition in which it is not active, but ready to act.
Perfect equilibrium is of course never attained, owing
to the incessant molecular change: indeed Life is inconsistent
with complete repose. Under another aspect the
molecular movements may be called <i>discharging</i>: they
constitute the dynamic condition of the organite, in which
its functional activity appears. The energy is now diverted,
liberated, and the surplus, over and above that
which is absorbed in formation, instead of slowly dribbling
off, gushes forth in a directed stream. The slow
formation of a secretion in a gland-cell, and the discharge
of that secretion, will illustrate this; or (if muscular <i>tone</i>
be admitted) the incipient contraction of the chronic
state, and the complete contraction of the dynamic state,
may also be cited.</p>

<p>164. The discharge which follows excitation may thus
be viewed as a <i>directed quantity</i> of molecular movement.
Because it is always strictly relative to the energy of
tension, and is inevitable when that tension attains a
certain surplus over what is required in construction,
there is a limit, 1°, to the growth and evolution of every
organite, and every organism (comp. Problem I. § <a href="#II_118">118</a>),
and, 2°, to its dynamical effect. When there is no surplus,
the organite is incapable of discharge: it is then
exhausted, i. e. will not respond to stimulus.</p>

<p>165. The speciality of nerve-tissue is its pre-eminence
in directive energy. Like all other tissues, it grows, develops,
and dies; but above all others it has what we call
<i>excitability</i>, or readiness in discharging its energy in a
directed stream. By its topographical distribution it
plays the functional part of exciting the activity of other
tissues: it transmits molecular disturbance from periphery
to centre, from centre to centre, and from centre
to muscles, vessels, and glands. When a muscle is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
excited it moves, and when a gland is excited it secretes;
but these actions end, so to speak, with themselves;
the muscle does not directly move any other muscle;<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>
the gland does not directly excite any other gland. The
nerve, on the contrary, has always a wide-spreading effect;
it excites a centre which is continuous with other centres;
and in exciting one muscle, usually excites a
group. Hence the nervous system is that <i>which binds
the different organs into a dynamic unity</i>. And Comparative
Anatomy teaches that there is a parallelism between
the development of this system and the efficient complexity
of the organism. As the tissues become more
and more specialized, and the organs more and more individualized,
they would become more and more unsuited
to the general service of the organism, were it not that a
corresponding development of the nervous system brought
a unifying mechanism.</p>

<p>The great instability of neurine, in other words, its
high degree of tension, renders it especially apt to disturb
the tension of other tissues. It is very variable;
and this variability will have to be taken into account
in explaining the restriction of discharges to particular
centres. A good example of exaggerated tension is furnished
by strychnine poisoning. The centres are then
so readily excitable that a touch, or a puff of cold air on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
the skin, will determine convulsions. And it is worthy
of remark that for some hours after this convulsive discharge
the centres return to something like their normal
state; and the animal may then be stroked, pinched,
or blown upon without abnormal reactions. But during
this interval the centres are slowly accumulating excess
of tension from the poisoned blood; and at the close, convulsions
will again follow the slightest stimulus. This
alternation of exhaustion and recrudescence is noticed
by Schröder van der Kolk in the periodicity of the phenomena
exhibited in spinal disease.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_23">THE PROPAGATION OF EXCITATION.</h3>

<p id="II_166">166. Understanding, then, that the propagation of an
excitation depends on the state of tension of the tissue,
and always follows the line of least resistance, whichever
that may be at the moment, we have to inquire whether
the transmission takes place only in one direction, from
periphery to centre in sensory nerves, and from centre to
periphery in motor nerves? By most physiologists this
is answered affirmatively. Indeed a special property has
been assigned to each nerve, in virtue of this imaginary
limitation of centripetal and centrifugal conduction. The
“nerve-current” (accepted as a physical fact, and not simply
a metaphor) is supposed to “flow” from the central
cells along the motor nerve to the muscles; but by a
strange oversight the current is also made to “flow” <i>towards</i>
the central cells which are said to produce it! Now
although the fact may be, and probably is, that normally
the sensory nerve, being stimulated at its peripheral end,
propagates the stimulation towards the centre, and the
motor nerve propagates its central stimulation towards the
periphery, the question whether each nerve is not capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
of transmission in both directions is not thus answered.
<i>A priori</i> it is irrational to assert that nerves fundamentally
alike in composition and structure are unlike in properties;
and we might as well suppose that a train of
gunpowder could only be fired at one end, as to suppose
that a nerve could only be excited at one end. And how
does the evidence support this <i>a priori</i> conclusion? Dubois
Reymond proved that each nerve conducted electricity
in both directions; but as Neurility has not been
satisfactorily shown to be identical with the electric current,
this may not be considered decisive. Such a doubt
does not hang over the following facts. M. Paul Bert,
pursuing John Hunter’s curious experiments on animal
<i>grafting</i>, has grafted the tail of a rat under the skin of
the rat’s back, the tip of the tail being inserted under the
skin, its base rising into the air, so that there is here an
inversion of the normal position. In the course of time
Sensibility gradually reappears in this grafted tail; and at
the end of about twelve months the rat not only feels
when the tail is pinched, but knows <i>where</i> the irritation
lies, and turns round to bite the pincers.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Here we have
a case of a sensory nerve reversed, yet transmitting stimulation
from the base to the tip of the tail, instead of from
the tip to the base, as in a normal organ. Vulpian and
Philippeaux having divided two nerves, united the central
end of the sensory nerve with the peripheral end of the
motor nerve; when the organic union was complete, and
each nerve was formed out of the halves of two different
nerves, the effect of pinching one of these was to produce
simultaneously pain and movement, showing that the excitation
was transmitted upwards to the centre, and downwards
to the muscles.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> It may be compared with a train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
of gunpowder having a loaded cannon at one end and a
bundle of straw at the other, when if a spark be dropped
anywhere on this train, the flame runs along in both directions,
explodes the cannon, and sets alight the straw.</p>

<p>167. Indeed we have only to remember the semi-liquid
nature of the axis cylinder to see at once that it must conduct
a wave of motion as readily in one direction as in
another. A liquid transmits waves in any direction according
to the initial impulse. There is consequently no
reason for asserting that because the usual direction is
centripetal in a sensory nerve, and centrifugal in a motor
nerve, each nerve is <i>incapable</i> of transmitting excitations
in both directions. And I think many phenomena are
more intelligible on the assumption that neural transmission
is in both directions. If the eye is fixed steadfastly
on a particular color during some minutes, the retina becomes
exhausted, and no longer responds to the stimulus
of that color: here the stimulation is of course centripetal.
But if instead of looking intently on the color, the
mind (in complete absence of light) pictures it intently,
<i>this cerebral image is equally capable of exhausting the retina</i>;
and unless we believe that color is a cerebral, not
a retinal phenomenon (which is my private opinion), we
must accept this as proof of a centrifugal excitation of a
sensory tract. Another illustration may be drawn from
the muscular sense. There may be a few sensory fibres
distributed to muscles; but even if the observations of
Sachs<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> should be confirmed, I do not think that all muscle
sensations can be assigned to these fibres, but that the
so-called motor fibres must also co-operate. When a nerve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
acts upon a muscle, the muscle reacts on the nerve; and
when a nerve acts on a centre, the centre reacts on the
nerve. The agitation of the central tissue cannot leave
the nerve which blends with it unaffected; the agitation
of the muscular tissue must also by a reversal of the
“current” affect its nerve. Laplace points out how the
movement of the hand which holds a suspended chain is
propagated along the chain to its terminus, and if when
the chain is at rest we once more set that terminus in
motion, the vibration will remount to the hand.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The
contraction of a muscle will not only stimulate the sensory
fibres distributed through it, but also, I conceive,
stimulate the very motor fibres which caused the contraction,
since these fibres blend with the muscle.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>168. To understand this, it is necessary to remember
that the stimulation of a nerve does not arise<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> in the
<i>changed state</i> of that nerve, but in the <i>process of change</i>,
i. e. the disturbance of the tension. The duration of the
stimulation is that of the changing process, and the intensity
increases with the differential of the velocity of
change. So that when a nerve which has been excited
by a change of state returns to its former state, this return—being
another change—is a new excitation. That it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
is not the changed state, but the change, which is operative,
explains the fact noted by Brown Séquard: a frog
poisoned by strychnine, when decapitated and all respiration
destroyed, will remain motionless for days together,
if carefully protected from all external excitation; but its
nervous system is in such a state of tension all this time
that the first touch produces general convulsions. Freusberg
also notes that if a brainless frog be suspended by
the lower jaw, and one foot be pinched, the other leg is
moved at first, then quickly droops again, and remains at
rest until the pincers are removed from the pinched foot,
when suddenly all four legs are violently moved by the
<i>stimulation which the simple removal produces</i>. Let us
also add the well-known and significant fact that if a
nerve be divided rapidly by a sharp razor, neither sensation
nor motion is produced, because the intensity of a
stimulus being, to speak mathematically, <i>the function of
the changing process</i>, the duration of the process is in this
case too brief. On the same ground the application of a
stimulus will excite no movement, if the force be very
slowly increased from zero to an intensity which will destroy
the nerve; but at any stage a <i>sudden</i> increase will
excite a movement.</p>

<p>169. We may group all the foregoing considerations in
this formula:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Law I.</span> Every neural process is due to a sudden disturbance
of the molecular tension. The liberated
energy is discharged along the lines of least resistance.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conditions which determine the lines of least resistance
are manifold and variable. The nervous system is a
continuous whole, each part of which is connected with
diverse organs; but in spite of this anatomical diversity,
the deeper uniformity causes the activity of each part to
depend on and involve the activity of every other, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
or less. By “more or less” is meant, that although the
excitation of one part necessarily affects the state of all
the others, because of their structural community, so that
<i>each sensation and each motion really represents a change
in the whole organism</i>, yet the responsive discharge determined
in each organ by this change, depends on the tension
of the organ and its centre at that moment. A bad
harvest really affects the whole nation; but its effect is
conspicuous on the welfare of the poor rather than of the
rich, although the price of bread is the same to rich and
poor. Nervous centres, and muscular or glandular organs,
differ in their excitability; one condition of this greater
excitability being the greater frequency with which they
are called into activity. The medulla oblongata is normally
more excitable than the medulla spinalis; the heart
more than the limbs. Hence a stimulus which will increase
the respiration and the pulse may have no <i>appreciable</i>
effect on the limbs; but some effect it must have.</p>

<p>170. Imagine all the nerve-centres to be a connected
group of bells varying in size. Every agitation of the
connecting wire will more or less agitate all the bells;
but since some are heavier than others, and some of the
cranks less movable, there will be many vibrations of
the wire which will cause some bells to sound, others
simply to oscillate without sounding, and others not sensibly
to oscillate. Even some of the lighter bells will not
ring if any external pressure arrests them; or if they are
already ringing, the added impulses, not being rhythmically
timed, will <i>arrest</i> the ringing. So the stimulus of a sensory
nerve agitates its centre, and through it the whole
system; usually the stimulation is mainly reflected on
the group of muscles innervated from that centre, because
this is the readiest path of discharge; but it sometimes
does not mainly discharge along this path, the line of least
resistance lying in another direction; and the discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
never takes this path without also irradiating upwards
and downwards through the central tissue. Thus irradiated,
it falls into the general stream of neural processes;
and according to the state in which the various centres
are at the moment it modifies their activity. A nervous
shock—physical or mental—sensibly affects all the organs.
A severe wound paralyzes, for a time, parts far
removed from the wounded spot. A blow on the stomach
will arrest the heart; a fright will do the same. Terror
relaxes the limbs, or sets them trembling; so does a concussion:
if a frog be thrown violently on the ground, all
its muscles are convulsed; but if the nerves of one limb
be divided before the shock, the muscles of that limb will
not be convulsed.</p>

<p>171. We are apt to regard the discharge on the moving
organs as if that were the sole response of a stimulation;
but although the most conspicuous, it is by no means
the most important effect. Besides exciting the muscles,
more or less, every neural process has its influence on the
organic processes of secretion, and effects thermal and
electrical changes. Schiff has demonstrated that every
sensation raises the temperature of the brain; Nothnagel,
that irritation of a sensory nerve causes constriction of
the cerebral arteries, and hence cerebral anæmia. Brown
Séquard and Lombard find the temperature of a limb
raised when its skin is pinched, and lowered when the
skin <i>elsewhere</i> is pinched. Georges Pouchet has shown that
fishes change color according to the brightness or darkness
of the ground over which they remain; and these
changes are dependent on nervous stimulation, mainly
through the eye, division of the optic nerves preventing
the change. These are so many <i>a posteriori</i> confirmations
of what <i>a priori</i> may be foreseen. They are cited here
merely to enforce the consideration, seldom adequately
kept before the mind, that every neural process is a change
which causes other changes in the whole organism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_24">STIMULI.</h3>

<p>172. Stimuli are classed as external and internal, or
physical and physiological. The one class comprises all
the agencies in the External Medium which <i>appreciably</i>
affect the organism; the other class all the changes <i>in</i> the
organism which appreciably disturb the equilibrium of
any organ. Although the pressure of the atmosphere,
for example, unquestionably affects the organism, and
determines organic processes, it is not reckoned as a stimulus
unless the effect become appreciable under sudden
variations of the pressure. In like manner the blood is
not reckoned among the internal stimuli, except when
sudden variations in its composition, or its circulation,
determine appreciable changes. Because the external
stimuli, and the so-called Senses which respond to them,
are more conspicuous than the internal stimuli and the
Systemic Senses, they have unfortunately usurped too
much attention. The massive influence of the Systemic
Sensations in determining the desires, volitions, and conceptions
of mankind has not been adequately recognized.
Yet every one knows the effect of impure air, or a congested
liver, in swaying the mental mood; and how a
heavy meal interferes with muscular and mental exertion.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>
What is conspicuous in such marked effects, is
less conspicuously, but not less necessarily, present in
slighter stimuli.</p>

<p>173. A constant pressure on the tympanum excites no
sound; only a rhythmic alternation of pressures will excite
the sensation. A constant temperature is not felt;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
only changes in temperature. If Light and Sound were
as uniform as the circulation of the blood, or the pressure
of the atmosphere, we should be seldom conscious of the
existence of these stimuli. But because the changes are
varied and marked, our attention is necessarily arrested
by them. The changes going on within the tissues are
too graduated to fix the attention; it is only by considering
their cumulative effects that we become impressed
with their importance. For example, the development
of the sexual glands determines conspicuous physical and
moral results—we note consequent effects on voice, hair,
horns, structure of the skull and size of the muscles, no
less than the rise of new feelings, desires, instincts, ideas.
Any organic interference with the activity of the ovaries
will alter the moral disposition of the animal: suppression
of this organic process means non-development of the
feelings of maternity; the moral superstructure is absent
because its physical basis is wanting.</p>

<p>174. Blood supplies the tissues with their plasmodes;
a constant supply of oxygenated blood is therefore necessary
to the vitality of the tissues. But it is an error to
suppose that oxygen is the special stimulus of nerve-centres,
or that their activity depends on their oxidation;
on the contrary, the deficiency of oxygen or surplus of
carbonic acid is that which stimulates. When saturated
with oxygen, the blood paralyzes respiration; when some
of the oxygen is withdrawn, respiration revives. Here—as
in all other cases—we have to remember that differences
in degree readily pass into differences in kind, so
that an excess of a stimulus produces a reversal of the
effect; thus although surplus of carbonic acid excites
respiratory movements, excess of carbonic acid causes
Asphyxia. Abundance of blood is requisite for the continuous
activity of nerve-centres; but while a temporary
deficiency of blood renders them more excitable, too great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
a deficiency paralyzes them. Anæmia, which causes great
excitability, and convulsions (so that nerves when dying
are most irritable), may easily become the cause of the
death of the tissue. There are substances which can only
be dissolved by a given quantity of liquid; if this quantity
be in excess, they are precipitated from the solution.
There are vibrations of a given order which cause each
string to respond; change the special order, and the
string returns to its repose.</p>

<p>In the stillness and darkness of the night we are excluded
from most of the external stimuli, yet a massive
stream of systemic sensations keeps the sensitive mechanism
active, and in sleep directs the dreams. The cramps
and epileptiform attacks which occur during sleep are
most probably due to the over-excitability produced by
surplus carbonic acid. To temporary anæmia may be
assigned the strange exaggeration of our sensations during
the moments which precede awakening; and the
greater vividness of dream-images.</p>

<p>It is only needful to mention in passing the varied
stimuli by which cerebral changes act upon the organism.
The mention of a name will cause a blush, a brightening
of the eye, a quickening of the pulse. The thought of
her absent infant will cause a flow of milk in the mother’s
breast.</p>

<p>175. We may formulate the foregoing considerations in
another law:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Law II.</span> The neural excitation, which is itself a change,
directly causes a change in the organ innervated,
and indirectly in the whole organism.</p></blockquote>

<p>The significance of this law is, that although for the
convenience of research and exposition we isolate one
organ from the rest of the organism, and one process from
all the co-operant processes, we have to remember that
this is an artifice, and that in reality there is no such
separation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_25">STIMULATION.</h3>

<p>176. Passing now from these general considerations to
their special application, we may formulate the law of
stimulation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Law III.</span> A faint or moderate stimulation increases the
activity of the organ; but beyond a certain limit,
increase of stimulation diminishes, and finally
arrests, the activity. Duration of stimulation is
equivalent to increase.</p></blockquote>

<p>A muscle stimulated contracts; if the stimulation be
repeated, the muscle becomes tetanized, and in this state
has reached its limit; a fresh stimulation then <i>relaxes</i> the
muscle. A very faint stimulation of the vagus quickens
the pulsation of the heart, but a slight increase, or duration
of the stimulation, slackens and arrests the heart.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
Every one knows how a moderate feeling of surprise,
pleasure, or pain quickens the heart and the respiration;
and how a shock of surprise, joy, grief, or great physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
pain depresses, and even arrests them. Excess of light is
blinding; excess of sound deafening.</p>

<p>177. The nervous system is incessantly stimulated,
and variably. Hence a great variation in the excitability
of different parts. While the regular and moderate
activity of one part is accompanied by a regular
flow of blood to it, so that there is a tolerably constant
rhythm of nutrition and discharge, any irregular or excessive
activity exhausts it, until there has been a nutritive
restoration. We can thus understand how one
centre may be temporarily exhausted while a neighboring
centre is vigorous. Cayrade decapitated a frog, and
suspended light weights to each of its hind legs; when
either leg was stimulated, the weight attached to it was
raised. After each repetition the weight was raised less
and less, until finally the weight ceased to be raised:
the centre had been exhausted. But now when the other
leg, which had been in repose, was stimulated, it energetically
contracted, and raised its attached weight; showing
that its centre was not exhausted by the action of the
other.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>178. This seems in contradiction with the principle
that the excitation of one centre is an excitation of all.
It also seems in contradiction with the principle urged
by Herzen, that irritation of one sciatic nerve <i>diminishes</i>
the excitability of the opposite leg; and this again seems
contradicted by the principle urged by Setschenow, that
although moderate excitation of one sciatic nerve will
diminish the excitability of the other, a powerful excitation
will increase it.</p>

<p>179. All three principles are, I believe, exact expressions
of experimental evidence; and their seeming contradictions
may be reconciled on a wider survey of the
laws of neural activity, interpreted according to the special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
conditions of each case. These laws may be conveniently
classified as laws of Discharge, and Laws of
Arrest; the second being only a particular aspect of the
first.</p>

<h3 id="sec_26">THE LAW OF DISCHARGE.</h3>

<p>180. The physiological independence of organs, together
with their intimate dependence in the organism,
and the fact that this organism is incessantly stimulated
from many sides at once, assure us <i>a priori</i> that the
“waves” of molecular movement due to each stimulus
must sometimes interfere and sometimes blend with
others, thus diverting or neutralizing the final discharge
in the one case, and in the other case swelling the current
and increasing the energy of the discharge. We
are accustomed to speak of one part “playing on another,”
sympathizing with another, and so on; but what is the
process expressed in these metaphors? When an idea,
or a painful sensation, quickens the pulse, or increases
the flow of a secretion, we are not to imagine that from
a spot in the cerebrum, or the surface, there is a nerve-fibre
going directly to the heart, or the gland, transmitting
an impulse; in each case the central tissue has
been agitated by a sudden change at the stimulated point,
and the discharge on heart and gland is the resultant of
this agitation along the lines of least resistance. The
nerves of the great toe, for example, pass into the spinal
cord at a considerable distance from the spot where the
nerves of the arm enter it; when, therefore, the great
toe is pinched, the arm does not move by direct stimulation
of its nerves, but by the indirect stimulation which
has traversed the whole central substance.</p>

<p>181. This is intelligible when we know that the whole
central substance is continuous throughout; but the difficulty
arises when we have to explain why, if this central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
substance is stimulated throughout, <i>only</i> arms and
legs respond; in other words, why the toe-centre “plays
upon” the arm-centre, and not on the others? When
a frog is decapitated, if we gently touch one leg with
the point of the scalpel, the leg will move, but only this
leg. Prick more forcibly, and both legs will move.
Keep on pricking, and all four legs are drawn up, and
the frog hops away. Each excitation was propagated
along the cord; but the discharge was restricted in the
first case to one limb, in the second to two, in the third
it involved all the muscles of the trunk. At the sight of
a friend a dog wags his tail gently: as there is no <i>direct</i>
connection between the optic nerves and the tail, this
playing of one centre on another must be by the agency
of intermediate centres; and we know that if the dog’s
spinal cord be divided, this excitation from the optic
centre is no longer possible, yet the tail will wag if the
abdomen be tickled, or the leg pinched. Now compare
the effect on the dog produced by the sight of his master,
or of a friend accustomed to take him out. There is no
longer a gentle wagging of the tail, but an agitation of
the whole body: he barks, leaps, and runs about; the
central stimulation is discharged through many outlets;
and could we test the effect, we should find an appreciable
alteration in the thermal and electrical condition
of the whole organism, with corresponding changes in
circulation, secretion, etc. So different are the consequences
of two slightly different retinal impressions
mingling their stimulations with the same mass of central
substance!</p>

<p>182. The discharge is determined by two conditions:
the state of tension, and the energy of the stimulation.
<i>The state of tension is increased by every stimulation which
falls short of a discharge</i>; that is to say, faint and frequent
stimulation augments the excitability, whereas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
powerful stimulation exhausts it. When, therefore, one
wave succeeds another in the same direction, it reaches
a centre more disposed to discharge; or, as Cayrade expresses
it, “a certain agitation of the cells is necessary
for the manifestation of their property of reaction, in
the same way that the concentric circles produced on
the surface of water by a falling stone are more rapid and
more numerous if a stone has already agitated the surface.”</p>

<p id="II_183">183. So much for the tension. What has been called
the energy of the stimulation is more complicated. It is
not measurable as a simple physical process; we cannot
say that a given quantity of any external force will determine
a given discharge. It is mostly complicated by
psychical processes, and these so modify the result that
instead of the predicted discharge there is arrest, or discharge
from another centre. Press a dog’s skin with
increasing violence, and the effect increases from pleasurable
to painful irritation; but whether the dog will
cry out and bite, or cry out and struggle to escape, depends
upon whether the pincher is a stranger or a friend.
If you hurt a dog while removing a thorn from its foot
it will cry out, but although the pain causes it to initiate
a biting movement, by the time your hand is reached
that movement will have been changed, and the dog
will lick the hand which he knows is hurting him in the
endeavor to relieve him of the thorn. The co-operation
of the mind is here evident enough. A purely psychical
process has interfered with the purely physiological
process. And I shall hereafter endeavor to show that
psychical processes analogous in kind though simpler in
degree are really co-operant in actions of the spinal cord.
The dog would be said to discriminate between the pain
inflicted by a friend, and the same pain inflicted by a
stranger. In other words, the sensitive mechanism would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
be differently determined in the direction of discharge,
although the initial stimulation was the same in each
case. If we admit that the resulting action is in each
case the consequence of the particular group of elements
co-operating, there will be no ground for denying that
analogous <i>discrimination</i> is manifested by the brainless
animal, who also responds differently to different external
stimuli, and differently to the same stimulus under different
central conditions. The brainless frog croaks if
its back be gently stroked with the handle of a scalpel;
but if the point be used, or if the handle be roughly
pressed, instead of croaking, the frog raises his leg in
defence. Here the difference in the peripheral irritation
has excited a different reaction in the centre; and
this might be interpreted as purely physical; if now the
leg be fastened, and the movement of defence be thus
prevented, the frog will employ the other leg; or adopt
some other means of relieving itself from the irritation.
It was a mass of registered experiences which determined
the dog not to bite his master. An analogous
registration of experiences determines the changed reactions
of the brainless frog. But this is a point which
can only be touched on in passing here, and it is touched
on merely to facilitate our exposition of the complicated
conditions of neural discharge. These may be formulated
in</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="xdent2">184. <span class="smcap">Law IV.</span> The simultaneous influence of several
stimuli, each of which separately excites the same
centre, is cumulative: stimuli then assist each
other, and their resultant is their <i>arithmetical</i> sum.</p>

<p class="xdent1">Simultaneous stimuli, each of which excites a different
centre, <i>interfere</i> with each other’s energy, and
their resultant is their <i>algebraical</i> sum.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In this law there is a condensed expression of that composition
of forces which may either result in Discharge or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Arrest. By simultaneity is not to be understood merely
the coincidence of impressions, but also the reverberations
of impressions not yet neutralized by others. Thus when
Sensibility is tested by the now common method,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> it is
found that if one leg is withdrawn after a lapse of, say,
ten pendulum beats, the other leg, which has not been
irritated, will nevertheless, on irritation, be withdrawn in
less than ten beats, provided the central agitation caused
by the first stimulation has <i>not yet subsided</i>. But, on the
contrary, the withdrawal will be considerably deferred, or
even prevented altogether, if at the same time that the leg
is acted on by the acid, a more powerful excitation takes
place in some other part of the body. In the one experiment
we see simultaneous excitation in the same centre
and the same direction. In the other simultaneous excitation
in different centres. The more powerful excitation
suppresses the discharge from the less powerful; but
although it prevails, it loses just as much force as it
arrests.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>185. There is another very interesting experiment by
Freusberg, which must be cited here.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> When the sciatic
nerve is divided, the frog’s leg is of course not withdrawn
from the acidulated water, because in that case no sensory
excitation is propagated from the skin to the centre; but
although there is no stimulation from the skin, there is
one from the muscles, as appears in the fact that if a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
weight be suspended on this leg, the other leg is more
rapidly withdrawn from the acidulated water—the action
of the muscles having affected the centre and increased
its excitability.</p>

<p>186. When the motor group of one leg is moderately
stimulated, the discharge is confined to the muscles of that
one leg; and according to Herzen the excitability of the
motor group of the other leg is thereby somewhat diminished.
But if the stimulation be increased, there is an
irradiation to the other group, which irradiation, although
not sufficient to excite a discharge, renders it much more
<i>ready</i> to discharge, so that a feeble stimulus suffices. This
accords with Setschenow’s observations, and is confirmed
by Freusberg’s experiment, in which, when one leg was
stimulated by acid, if the acid were not wiped off but
allowed to keep up the irritation, the other leg moved
without being irritated; and this other leg having come
to rest, when in its turn dipped in the acid, was more rapidly
withdrawn than the first leg had been on first being
stimulated; showing that the central groups had become
more excitable by the stimulation of either leg.</p>

<p>187. While it is intelligible that an excitation of one
group should increase the activity of neighboring groups,
by an increase of the vascular activity of the region, it is
not so readily intelligible why the feebler excitation of
one group should diminish the excitability of its neighbor;
yet the facts seem to warrant both statements.</p>

<p>188. The conditions which determine Discharge are
obscure. We may, however, say that anatomical and
physiological data force the conclusion that whenever the
central tissue is powerfully stimulated in any one part,
there is either a discharge, or a greater tension (tendency
to discharge) in every other part; in consequence of which,
every fresh stimulus in the <i>same</i> direction finds the parts
more prepared to react; while every fresh stimulus in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
<i>contrary</i> direction meets with a proportional resistance.
Stated thus generally, the principle is clear enough; but
the immense complication of stimulations, and the statical
variableness of the organs, renders its application to particular
cases extremely obscure. Why does the ticking
of a clock arrest the attention, even with unpleasant obtrusiveness,
at one time, and presently afterwards cease to
be heard at all? Why does the cut of a knife cause intense
pain, and a far greater cut received during the heat
and agitation of a quarrel pass unfelt? Why will the
same external force excite convulsions in all the muscles,
and at another time scarcely be distinguishable? These
are consequences of the temporary condition of the centres;
but there are permanent conditions which in some
organisms determine equally variable results. Thus the
shock of terror which will simply agitate one person, will
develop an epileptic attack in another, and insanity in a
third; just as exposure to cold will in one person congest
the liver, in another the lungs. A loud and sudden sound
causes winking in most persons, and in many a sort of
convulsive shock. The harsh noise of a file causes a
shiver in some persons, and in others “sets the teeth on
edge,” while in others it causes an increased flow of saliva.</p>

<p>189. Nerves and centres have different degrees of excitability.
The nerve-terminals in the skin are more
sensitive to impressions than those in the mucous membrane;
those in the alimentary canal are more sensitive
than those in the peritoneum; and all nerve-terminals are
more sensitive than nerve-trunks. A touch on the surface
of the larynx will produce a cough, but the nerve-trunk
itself may be pinched or galvanized without producing
any such reflex. Moreover, there is the difference
of grouping. If the skin of the abdomen be tickled, there
is a reflex on the adductor and extensor muscles of the
leg; but these movements are reversed if the skin of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
back be tickled. Nor indeed are these movements invariable
in either case; the one series will sometimes quite
suddenly change to the other, if the irritation is kept up.
That one and the same stimulus applied to the same spot
should now excite this group and now the other, shows
that <i>both</i> motor groups are affected, and that the discharge
takes place from the one which at the time being is in the
highest tension. The alternation of tension explains rhythmical
discharge.</p>

<h3 id="sec_27">THE LAW OF ARREST.</h3>

<p id="II_190">190. The Law of Arrest is only another aspect of the
Law of Discharge, and may be regarded as the conflict of
excitations. If a stranger enters the room where a woman
lies in labor, there will often be caused a sudden cessation
of the uterine contractions.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Again, every one knows how
the breathing and the beating of the heart are arrested
by the idea of danger. The arrest is in each of the three
cases only temporary, because when the shock of the new
stimulus has caused its discharge (arrest), the peripheral
irritation which caused the former discharges resumes its
influence, and uterus, heart, and diaphragm begin to move
again, even more energetically. Note, moreover, that not
only will the cerebral excitation arrest the spinal discharge—an
idea check the contractions of the uterus or
the heart—but the reverse also takes place. The brain
of the woman may be intently occupied with some scheme
for the education or welfare of her expected child, but no
sooner do the labor pains set in, than all these cerebral
combinations are arrested.</p>

<p>191. One sensation arrests another; one idea displaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
another. If the foreleg of a headless frog be irritated,
the hind-leg will also be moved by the stimulation; or
<i>vice versa</i>. Here there has been a propagation of the excitation
in either direction. But if while the legs are
thus irritated, and the centres are ready to discharge, another
and more powerful irritation reach the centre—say
by pinching the skin of the back—there will be no
discharge on the legs. If the vagus be irritated, the heart
is arrested; but this does not take place if at the same
time, or immediately before, the foot has been sharply
pinched. A few gentle taps on the abdomen suffice to
stop the heart; but if a drop of acid be previously placed
on the skin, we tap in vain, the heart continues to beat.
Brown Séquard cites several cases in which convulsions
were arrested by irritation of sensitive surfaces;<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and
Dr. Crichton Browne records a case of a patient in whom
there was abolition of spinal reflex, due to cerebral irritation:
tickling the soles of the feet, or pricking the toes,
which normally excites reflex movements, in this case
excited none whatever. “This seems to prove that nerve
currents, set in motion by irritation of the brain, or some
of its convolutions, transmitted down the cord, may inhibit
reflex action.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Examples might indefinitely be
multiplied. Pinch the skin of a rabbit between the eyes,
and you will observe that pulse and respiration are slackened;
but if the tail, which is very sensitive, be pinched,
this slackening is only momentary, and is succeeded by a
quickening—unless the pain be great. Even the effect
of intense pain may be neutralized by stimulating the
vagus—just as the effect of stimulating the vagus
may be neutralized by pain. Claude Bernard found
that having dropped ammonia on the eyelid of a dog,
the pain caused a convulsive closure of the lid; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
on galvanizing the vagus, the lid opened again, to be
closed when the galvanism ceased.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> When the heart is
beating faintly (as in syncope), any irritating vapor applied
to the nostrils will cause a more energetic pulsation;
yet a very irritating vapor lowers the action of the
heart beating normally, and will even arrest that of a
rabbit. Over-stimulation has almost always the opposite
effect of moderate stimulation.</p>

<p>192. While there seems every reason to believe that
an excitation necessarily affects the whole cerebro-spinal
axis, there is no doubt that there is a certain restriction
of this irradiation to definite paths, i. e. the responsive
discharge is confined to definite groups. Some of these
restrictions are connate pathways: we bring them with
us at birth; but most of them are pathways acquired
after birth. The boy who sheds tears at parting from his
mother when he goes to school, will shed no tears when
he parts from her to go to college, nay, perhaps will shed
none when he parts from her forever: not that his love
has lessened, but that the idea of such expression of it as
“unmanly” has become an organized tendency and arrests
the tears. A youth of southern race, who has not learned
to be ashamed of tears, weeps freely under such circumstances.</p>

<p>193. The pathways organized at birth are not many.
Examples are the inspiration which follows expiration;
the movements of coughing when the larynx is tickled;
the movements of swallowing, sneezing, etc. Even these
may be arrested for a brief time by what is called “the
will”; but when once the discharge begins in any part
of the mechanism, the whole group is necessarily involved
and the action is then inevitable. Many of the reflex
actions which are universal are nevertheless acquired.
Winking, for instance, when an object approaches the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
eye, is universal among us, but is never seen in infants,
nor in animals. It is even doubtful whether the drawing
up of the leg when the toes are pinched is not an
acquired reflex. Doubtful, I mean, in this sense, that
although the fact of non-withdrawal is observable in
infants, who cannot localize their sensations, this may be
due to the imperfect development of their nervous system.
Mr. Spalding has proved that although the callow
bird cannot fly, the mechanism of flight is no sooner
developed than the action follows at once, without any
previous tentative experiences.</p>

<p>194. By experience we learn to restrict the paths of
irradiation, so as to wink with one eye while the other is
unmoved, to bend one finger while the rest are extended,
to move one limb, or one group of muscles, while the
others are at rest; in short, to execute any one particular
action, and not at the same time agitate superfluously
many other organs. The boy when first learning to write
is unable to prevent the simultaneous motions of tongue
and legs, which are ludicrously irrelevant to the purpose
of writing; but he learns to keep all his organs in subjection,
and only the eyes and hands active.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> An analogous
restriction takes place in thinking. A train of
thought is kept up by the exclusion of all suggestions
which are not pertinent; and the power of the thinker is
precisely this power of concentration.</p>

<h3 id="sec_28">THE HYPOTHESIS OF INHIBITORY CENTRES.</h3>

<p>195. The facts and their formulated laws which have
just been adduced furnish a sufficient explanation of all the
phenomena of arrest which of late years have been detached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
and assigned to a special mechanism of inhibitory nerves
and centres. In spite of the eminent authorities countenancing
the hypothesis of a particular set of inhibitory
nerves, and particular centres of inhibition, I must confess
that the hypothesis appears to me inadmissible; and
that I side with those physiologists who hold that each
nerve and each centre has its inhibitory action. Indeed,
if the action of arrest be, as I maintain, only another
aspect of the action of discharge, the result of the conflict
of forces, to say that all centres have the property of excitation,
is to say that all have the properties of discharge
and arrest: the discharge is only the resultant of the conflict
along the line of least resistance; the arrest is the
effect of the conflict along the line of greatest resistance.
The observed phenomena of arrest are so varied and numerous
that the upholders of the inhibitory hypothesis
have been forced to invent not only arresting centres, but
centres which arrest these arresting centres! Dr. Lauder
Brunton candidly remarks: “At present our notions
of nervous action seem to be getting as involved as the
Ptolemaic system of astronomy, and just as epicycles
became heaped upon cycles, so nerve-centres are being
added to nerve-centres. And yet, clumsy though the system
may be, it serves at present a useful purpose, and
may give real aid until a better is discovered.” I do not
think a Copernicus is needed to discover a better. The
Law of Arrest as a general neural law suffices, when the
right conception of a <i>centre</i> as a physiological rather than
an anatomical designation is admitted. (See p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>.)</p>

<p>196. It would be out of place here to consider the conflicting
evidence which at present renders the question
of the movements of the heart one of the most unsatisfactory
in the whole range of experimental physiology.
After devoting much time to it, and after writing a long
chapter on it, I suppress what I had written, and content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
myself with the statement that no advantage whatever is
derived from the hypothesis of a special mechanism of
arrest, unless perhaps in giving a temporary precision to
the direction of research. I mean that the search for
special centres may lead to the discovery of the particular
paths to which an impulse is restricted in any one
action: as, for instance, the vagus in retarding the pulsation
of the heart. If the cerebrum can determine a movement,
and combine various movements, it is a centre of
arrest; if the cerebellum can determine and regulate
movements, it is a centre of arrest; if the medulla oblongata
can determine and regulate movements, it is a centre
of arrest; if the medulla spinalis can determine and combine
movements, it is a centre of arrest; if a nerve can
dilate a constricted blood-vessel, or constrict a dilated
one, it is a nerve of arrest. In other words, every centre
exerts its action either in discharging, or in arresting the
discharge of some other centre.</p>

<p>The physiological process of Arrest may be physically
interpreted as Interference;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> not that the process in
nerve-tissue is to be understood as the <i>same</i> as that observed
in fluids, or that the metaphor of neural waves is
to be taken for more than an intelligible picturing of the
process; the difference in the two agents forbids our
admitting the resemblance to be more than analogical.
Thus interpreted, however, we see that not only will one
centre arrest the action of another, but one nerve may be
made to arrest itself! I mean that, under similar conditions
of interference, the stimulation which normally follows
on external stimulus may be inhibited by a previous,
or a counter stimulation. Thus the nerve which will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
stimulated by a chemical or mechanical stimulus, wholly
fails to react if a constant current is passing through it,
although this constant current does not itself cause a constant
contraction. Remove the electrodes, and then the
chemical or mechanical stimulus takes effect. Or the
experiment may be reversed: let the nerve be placed in a
saline solution, and the muscles will be at once thrown
into violent contraction; if the electrodes are now applied
to the nerve, the contractions suddenly cease, to begin
again directly the electrodes are removed.</p>

<h3 id="sec_29">ANATOMICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE LAWS.</h3>

<p>197. The problem for the anatomist is twofold: First,
given the organ, he has to determine its function, or <i>vice
versa</i>, given the part of an organ, to determine its functional
relation; secondly, given the function, he has to
determine its organ. The structural and functional relations
of nerves and centres have been ascertained in a
general way; we are quite sure that the posterior nerves
carry excitations from sensitive surfaces, that the anterior
nerves carry excitations to muscles and glands; and that
the central gray substance not only reflects a sensory excitation
as a motor excitation, but propagates an excitation
along the whole cerebro-spinal axis. But when we come
to a more minute analysis of the functional activities, and
endeavor to assign their respective values to each part of
the organic mechanism, the excessive complexity and delicacy
of the mechanism baffles research. We are forced
to grope our way; and the light of the hypothetic lamps
which we hold aloft as often misdirects as helps us. The
imaginary anatomy which at present gains acceptance, no
doubt seems to simplify explanations; but this seeming
turns out to be illusory when closely examined. The
imagined arrangement of fibres and cells we have seen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
be not in agreement with observation; and were it demonstrable,
it would not account for the laws of propagation.
Suppose sensory fibres to terminate in cells, and fibres
from these to pass <i>upwards</i> to other sensory cells and
<i>transversely</i> to motor cells, how in such a connected system
could irradiations take place, if the law of isolated
conduction were true? And how could isolated conduction
take place, if the excitation of a part were necessarily
the excitation of the whole? Why, for example, is
pain not always irradiated? Why is it even localized in
particular spots, determining movements in particular
muscles; and when irradiation takes place, why is it circumscribed,
or—and this is very noteworthy—manifested
in two widely different places, the intercostal and
trigeminal nerves? Why does the irritation of intestinal
worms manifest itself now by troubles of vision, now by
noises in the ear, and now by convulsions?</p>

<p>198. Answers to such questions must be sought elsewhere.
Our first search should be directed to the anatomical
data, which have hitherto been so imprudently
disregarded. Under the guidance of the laws formulated
in this chapter, let us accept the anatomical fact of a vast
network forming the ground-substance in which cells and
fibres are embedded, and with which they are continuous;
let us accept the physiological principle Of similarity of
property with similarity of composition and structure;
let us accept the hypothesis that the discharge of neural
energy is dependent on the degree of stimulus and the
degree of tension at the time being—and we shall have
at least a general theory of the process, though there will
still remain great obscurities in particular applications.
We shall have before us a vast network of pathways, all
equally capable of conducting an excitation, but not all
equally and at all moments open. It will always be difficult
to determine what are the conditions which at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
moment favor or obstruct particular openings. Paths that
have been frequently traversed will of course be more
readily traversed again; but this very facility will <i>sometimes</i>
be an obstacle, since it will have caused that path
to be preoccupied, or have fatigued the organ to which it
leads.</p>

<p>199. Since the escape of an excitation must always be
along the lines of least resistance, an obvious explanation
of the restriction to certain paths has been to assume that
some fibres and cells have naturally greater resistance
than others. But this explanation is simply a restatement
of the fact in other words. What is this greater
resistance? Why is it present in one fibre rather than in
another? We should first have to settle whether the
resistance was in the nervous pathway itself, or in the
centre, or in the organ innervated; an excitation might
pass along the nervous tract, yet fail to change the state
of the centre, or the organ, sufficiently to produce an appreciable
response; and only those parts where an appreciable
response was produced would then be considered as
having had the pathways of propagation open.</p>

<p>200. When we reflect on the innumerable stimulations
to which the organism is subjected from so many various
points, and remember further that <i>each stimulation leaves
behind it a tremor which does not immediately subside</i>, we
shall conceive something of the excessive complexity of
the mechanism, and marvel how any order is established
in the chaos. What we must firmly establish in our
minds is that the mechanism is essentially a <i>fluctuating</i>
one, its elements being combined, recombined, and resolved
under infinite variations of stimulation. If it were
a mechanism of fixed relations, such as we find in machines,
or in the “mechanism of the heavens,” we might
accept the notion of certain organites having greater resistance
as a consequence of their structure, just as one muscle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
resists being moved by the impulse which will move
another. Nor is it doubtful that such differences exist in
nervous organites; but the laws of central excitation are
not interpretable by any such hypothesis, since we know
that the paths which were closed against an impulse of
considerable energy may be all open to an impulse of
feebler energy, and that a slight variation in the stimulus
will be followed by a wide irradiation. For example, a
grain or two of snuff will excite the violent and complex
act of sneezing, but the nerves of the nasal cavity may
be pinched, cut, or rubbed, without producing any such
result. One group of nervous organites will fail to involve
the activity of neighboring groups; and the simple
movement of a single organ is then all that appreciably
follows the stimulation; yet by a slight change in the
stimulation, the organites are somewhat differently
grouped, and the result is a complex movement of many
organs. It is this fluctuation of combination in the organites
which renders education and progress possible. Those
combinations which have very frequently been repeated
acquire at last an automatic certainty.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COURSE OF MODERN THOUGHT.</span></h2>

<p>1. <span class="firstword">Modern</span> Philosophy has moved along two increasingly
divergent lines. One, traversed by Galileo, Descartes,
Newton, and Laplace, had for its goal the absolute
disengagement of the physical from the mental, i. e. the
objective from the subjective aspect of phenomena, so
that the physical universe, thus freed from all the complexities
of Feeling, might be interpreted in mechanical
terms. As a preliminary simplification of the problem
this was indispensable; only by it could the First Notion
of primitive speculation be replaced by the Theoretic
Conception of scientific speculation.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The early thinker
inevitably invested all external objects with properties
and qualities similar to those he assigned to human
beings, and their actions he assigned to human motives.
Sun, moon, and stars seemed living beings; flames, streams,
and winds were supposed to be moved by feelings such
as those known to move animals and men. Nor was
any other conception then possible: men could only interpret
the unknown by the known, and their standard
of all action was necessarily drawn from their own actions.
Not having analyzed Volition and Emotion, above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
all not having localized these in a neuro-muscular system,
men could not suspect that the movements of planets
and plants, and of streams and stones, had motors of a
different kind from the movements of animals. The scientific
conception of inert insensible Matter was only
attained through a long education in abstraction; and is
assuredly never attained by animals, or by savages. But
no sooner were vital conditions recognized, than the difference
between vital and mechanical movements emerged.
When men learned that many of their own actions were
unaccompanied either by Love or Hate, by Pleasure or
Pain, and that many were unprompted by conscious intention,
while others were unaccompanied by conscious
sensation, they easily concluded that wherever the special
conditions of Feeling were absent, the actions must have
some other motors. Intelligence, Emotion, Volition, and
Sensation being one by one stripped away from all but a
particular class of bodies, nothing remained for the other
bodies but insensible Matter and Motion. This was the
Theoretic Conception which science substituted for the
First Notion. It was aided by the observation of the
misleading tendency of interpreting physical phenomena
by the human standard, substituting our fancies in the
place of facts, manipulating the order of the universe according
to our imagination of what it might be, or ought
to be. Hence the vigilance of the new school in suppressing
everything pertaining to the subjective aspect
of phenomena, and the insistance on a purely objective
classification, so that by this means we might attain to
a knowledge of things as they are. By thus withdrawing
Life and Mind from Nature, and regarding the universe
solely in the light of Motion and the laws of Motion,
two great scientific ends were furthered, namely, a classification
of conceptions, and a precision of terms. Objective
phenomena made a class apart, and the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
aim of research was to find a mathematical expression
for all varieties under this class. Masses were conceived
as aggregates of Atoms, and these were reduced to mathematical
points. Forces were only different modes of Motion.
All the numberless differences which perception
recognized as <i>qualities</i> in things, were reduced to mere
variations in <i>quantity</i>. Thus all that was particular and
concrete became resolved by analysis into what was general
and abstract. The Cosmos then only presented a
problem of Mechanics.</p>

<p>2. During this evolution, the old Dualism (which conceived
a material universe sharply demarcated from the
mental universe) kept its ground, and attained even
greater precision. The logical distinction between Matter
and Mind was accepted as an essential distinction, i. e.
representing distinct reals. There was on the one side a
group of phenomena, Matter and Force; on the other side
an unallied group, Feeling and Thought: between them
an impassable gulf. How the two were brought into
relation, each acting and reacting on the other, was
dismissed as an “insoluble mystery”—or relegated to
Metaphysics for such minds as chose to puzzle over questions
not amenable to experiment. Physics, confident
in the possession of mathematical and experimental
methods which yielded definite answers to properly restricted
questions, peremptorily refused to listen to any
suggestion of the kind. And the career of Physics was
so triumphant that success seemed to justify its indifference.</p>

<p>3. In our own day this analytical school has begun to
extend its methods even to the mental group. Having
reduced all the objective group to mathematical treatment,
it now tries to bring the subjective group also
within its range. Not only has there been more than
one attempt at a mathematical Psychology; but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
attempts to reduce Sensibility, in its subjective no less
than in its objective aspect, to molecular movement.
Here also the facts of Quality are translated into facts
of Quantity; and all diversities of Feeling are interpreted
as simply quantitative differences.</p>

<p>4. Thus far the one school. But while this Theoretic
Conception stripped Nature of consciousness, motive, and
passion, rendering it a mere aggregate of mathematical
relations, a critical process was going on, which, analyzing
the nature of Perception, was rapidly moving towards
another goal. Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, directing
their analysis exclusively to the subjective aspect of
phenomena, soon broke down the barriers between the
physical and mental, and gradually merged the former in
the latter. Matter and its qualities, hitherto accepted as
independent realities, existing where no Mind perceived
them, were now viewed as the creations of Mind—their
existence was limited to a state of the percipient.
The old Dualism was replaced by Idealism. The Cosmos,
instead of presenting a problem of Mechanics, now presented
a problem of Psychology. Beginning with what
are called the secondary qualities of Matter, the psychological
analysis resolved these into modes of Feeling.
“The heat which the vulgar imagine to be in the fire and
the color they imagine in the rose are not there at all,
but are in us—mere states of our organism.” Having
gained this standing-place, there was no difficulty in extending
the view from the secondary to the primary qualities.
These also were perceptions, and only existed in
the percipient. Nothing then remained of Matter save
the hypothetical unknown <i>x</i>—the postulate of speculation.
Kant seemed forever to have closed the door
against the real Cosmos when he transformed it into a
group of mental forms—Time, Space, Causality, Quantity,
etc. He propounded what may be called a theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
of mental Dioptrics whereby a pictured universe became
possible, as Experience by its own <i>a priori</i> laws moulded
<i>itself</i> into a consistent group of appearances, which produced
the illusion of being a group of realities. He admitted,
indeed, that by the operation of Causality we are
compelled to believe in a Real underlying the appearances;
but the very fact that this Causality is a <i>subjective
law</i>, is proof, he said, of its not being an <i>objective truth</i>.
Thus the aim of the mechanical conception was to free
research from the misleading complexities of subjective
adulterations, and view <i>things as they are</i> apart from their
<i>appearances</i>; but this aim seemed illusory when Psychology
showed that Time, Space, Matter, and Motion were
themselves not objective reals except in so far as they
represented subjective necessities; and that, in short,
things <i>are</i> just what they <i>appear</i>, since it is only in the
relation of external reals to internal feelings that objects
exist for us.</p>

<p>5. Idealism has been the outcome of the psychological
method. It has been of immense service in rectifying
the dualistic conception, and in correcting the mechanical
conception. It has restored the subjective factor, which
the mechanical conception had eliminated. It has brought
into incomparable clearness the fundamental fact that all
our knowledge <i>springs from</i>, and is <i>limited by</i>, Feeling. It
has shown that the universe represented in that knowledge,
can only be a picture of the system of things as
these exist in relation to our Sensibility. But equally
with the mechanical conception it has erred by incomplete
analysis. For a complete theory of the universe,
or of any one phenomenon, those elementary conditions
which analysis has provisionally set aside must finally be
restored. When Quality is replaced by Quantity, this is
an artifice of method, which does not really correspond
with fact. The quality is the fact given in feeling, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
we analytically refer to quantitative differences, but which
can never be wholly resolved into them, since it must be
presupposed throughout. One color, for example, may be
distinguished from another as having more or fewer undulations;
and so we may by abstraction, letting drop all
qualitative characters, make a scale of undulations to
represent the scale of colors. But this is an ideal figment.
It is the representation of one series of feelings
by another series of different feelings. No variation of
undulations will really correspond with variation in color,
unless we reintroduce the suppressed <i>quality</i> which runs
through all color. Attempt to make one born blind feel,
or even understand, Color by describing to him the kind
of wave-movement which it is said to be, and the vanity
of the effort will be manifest. Movement he knows, and
varieties of movement as given in <i>tactile and muscular
sensations</i>; but no combination and manipulation of such
experiences can give him the specific sensation of Color.
That is a purely subjective state, which he is incapable
of experiencing, simply because one of the essential factors
is absent. One set of objective conditions is present,
but the other set (his sense-organ) is defective. Without
the “greeting of the spirit” undulations cannot become
colors (nor even undulations, for these also are forms of
feeling). Besides the sense-organ there is needed the
feeling of Difference, which is itself the product of past
and present feelings. The reproduction of other colors,
or other shades of color, is necessary to this perception of
difference; and this involves the element of Likeness and
Unlikeness between what is produced and reproduced.
So that a certain mental co-operation is requisite even
for the simplest perception of quality. In fact, psychological
analysis shows that even Motion and Quantity,
the two objective terms to which subjective Quality is
reduced, are themselves Fundamental Signatures of Feeling;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
so that here, as elsewhere, it is only by analytical
artifice that the objective can be divorced from the subjective.
Matter <i>is</i> for us the Felt; its Qualities are differences
of Feeling.</p>

<p>6. Not that this result is to be interpreted as freeing
our Theoretic Conception from its objective side, and
landing us in Idealism, which suppresses the real universe.
The denial of all reality apart from our minds, is
a twofold mistake: it confounds the conception of general
relations with particular relations, declaring that because
the External in its relation to the sentient organism can
only be what it is felt to be, therefore it can have no
<i>other</i> relations to other individual reals. This is the first
mistake. The second is the disregard of the constant
presence of the objective real in every fact of Feeling:
the Not-Self is emphatically present in every consciousness
of Self.</p>

<p>The legitimate conclusion is neither that of Dualism
nor of Idealism, but what I have named Reasoned Realism
(<i>Problems</i>, Vol. I. p. 201), which reconciles Common Sense
with Speculative Logic, by showing that although the
<i>truth</i> of things (their <i>Wahrheit</i>) is just what we perceive
in them (our <i>Wahrnehmung</i>), yet their <i>reality</i> is this, and
much more than this. <i>Things</i> are what they are felt to
be; and what they are thought to be, when thoughts are
symbols of the perceptions. Idealism declares that they
are <i>nothing but</i> this. It is against this <i>nothing but</i> that
Common Sense protests; and the protest is justified by
Reasoned Realism, which, taking a comprehensive survey
of the facts, thus answers the idealist: “Your synthesis
is imperfect, since it does not include <i>all</i> the data—notably
it excludes the fact of an objective or Not-Self element
in every feeling. You may, conceivably, regard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
whole universe as nothing but a series of changes in your
consciousness; but you cannot hope to convince me that
I myself am simply a change in yourself, or that my
body is only a fleeting image in your mind. Hence although
I conclude that the Not-Self is to you, as to me,
undivorceable from Self, inalienable from Feeling, in so
far as it is felt, yet there must nevertheless be for both
of us an existence not wholly coextensive with our own.
<i>My</i> world may be my picture of it; <i>your</i> world may be
your picture of it; but there is something common to
both which is more than either—an existent which has
different relations to each. <i>You</i> are not <i>me</i>, nor is the
pictured Cosmos <i>me</i>, although I picture it. Looking at
you and it, I see a vast whole of which you are a small
part; and such a part I conclude myself to be. It is at
once a picture and the pictured; at once subjective and
objective. To me all your modes of existence are objective
aspects, which, drawing from my own experience, I
believe to have corresponding subjective aspects; so that
your emotions, which to me are purely physical facts, are
to you purely mental facts. And psychological analysis
assures me that all <i>physical facts are mental facts expressed
in objective terms</i>, and <i>mental facts are physical facts expressed
in subjective terms</i>.”</p>

<p id="II_7">7. But while Philosophy thus replaces the conceptions
of Dualism and Idealism by the conception of the Two-fold
Aspect, the special sciences in their analytical career
have disregarded the problem altogether. The mechanical
theory of the universe not only simplified research
by confining itself solely to the objective aspect of phenomena,
but by a further simplification set aside all vital
and chemical relations, to deal exclusively with mechanical
relations. In ascertaining the mathematical relations
of the planetary system, no elucidation could possibly
be gained from biological or chemical conceptions; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
planets therefore were provisionally stripped of everything
not mechanical. In systematizing the laws of motion,
it was necessary to disengage the abstract relations
from everything in any way resembling spontaneity, or
extra-mechanical agency: Matter was therefore, by a
bold fiction, declared to be inert, and its Motion regarded
as something superadded from without.</p>

<p>7<i>a</i>. And this was indispensable for the construction
of those ideal laws which are the objects of scientific
research. Science, as we often say, is the systematization
of Experience under the forms of ideal constructions.
Experience implies Feeling, and certain fundamental Signatures,
all reducible to the primary discernment of Likeness
and Unlikeness. Hence Science is first a <i>classification</i>
of qualities or discerned likenesses and differences;
next a <i>measurement</i> of quantities of discerned likenesses
and differences. Although measurement is itself a species
of classification, it is distinguished by the adoption of a
standard unit of comparison, which, being precise and
unvarying, enables us to express the comparisons in precise
and unvarying symbols. Whether the unit of length
adopted be an inch, a foot, a yard, a mile, the distance
of the earth from the sun, or the distances of the fixed
stars, the quantities thus measured are symbols admitting
of one invariable interpretation. The exactness of
the mathematical sciences is just this precision and invariability
of their symbols, and is not, as commonly
supposed, the source of any superior certainty as to the
facts. The classificatory sciences, which deal with qualities
rather than with quantities, may be equally <i>certain</i>,
and represent fuller <i>knowledge</i>, because involving more
varied feelings, but they cannot pretend to exactness.
Even on the quantitative side, certainty is not identical
with exactness. I may be quite certain that one block
of marble is larger than another—meaning that it affects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
me more voluminously—but I cannot know how much
larger it is, without interpreting my feelings by the standard
of quantity—the how-muchness as represented by
that standard. The immense advantages of exact measurement
need not be insisted on. The Biological Sciences,
which are predominantly classificatory, can never
rival the Cosmological Sciences in exactness; but they
may reach a fuller knowledge; and their certainty will
assume more and more the character of exactness as
methods of measurement are applied to their classifications
of qualities. The qualitative and quantitative aspects
of phenomena are handled by the two great instruments,
Logic and Mathematics, the second being only a
special form of the first. These determine the general
conceptions which are derived from our perceptions, and
the whole constitute Experience.</p>

<p>8. What is the conclusion to which these considerations
lead? It is that the separation of the quantitative
from the qualitative aspect of phenomena—the objective
mechanical from the subjective psychological—is a logical
artifice indispensable to research; but it is only an
artifice.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> In pursuance of this artifice, each special science
must be regarded as the search after special analytical
results; and meanwhile this method should be respected,
and no confusion of the boundaries between one science
and another should be suffered. Mechanical problems
must not be confused by the introduction of biological
relations. Biological problems must not be restricted to
mechanical relations. I do not mean that the mechanical
relations present in biological phenomena are not
to be sought, and, when found, to be expressed in mechanical
terms; I mean that such an inquiry must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
strictly limited to mechanical relations. Subjective relations
are not to be denied, because they are provisionally
set aside, in an inquiry into objective relations; but we
must carefully distinguish which of the two orders we
are treating of, and express each in its appropriate terms.
This is constantly neglected. For example, nothing is
more common than to meet such a phrase as this: “A
<i>sensory impression</i> is transmitted as a <i>wave</i> of <i>motion</i> to
the brain, and there being transformed into a state of
<i>consciousness</i>, is again reflected as a <i>motor</i> impulse.”</p>

<p>The several sciences having attained certain analytical
results, it remains for Philosophy to co-ordinate these
into a doctrine which will furnish general conceptions
of the World, Man, and Society. On the analytical side
a mechanical theory of the universe might be perfected,
but it would still only be a theory of mechanical relations,
leaving all other relations to be expressed in other
terms. We cannot accept the statement of Descartes
that Nature is a vast mechanism, and Science the universal
application of mathematics. The equation of a
sphere, however valuable from a geometrical point of
view, is useless as an explanation of the nature and properties
of the spherical body in other relations. And so
a complete theory of the mechanical relations of the
organism, however valuable in itself, would be worthless
in the solution of a biological problem, unless supplemented
by all that mechanical terms are incompetent to
express.</p>

<p>9. The course of biological speculation has been similar
to the cosmological. It also began with a First
Notion, which compendiously expressed the facts of
Experience. Nor can any Theoretic Conception be finally
adopted which does away with these facts, known with
positive certainty, and popularly expressed in the phrase:
“I have a body, and a soul.” We may alter the phrase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
either into “I <i>am</i> a body, and I <i>am</i> a soul”; or into, “My
body is only the manifestation of my soul”; or, “My soul
is only a function of my body”; but the fundamental experiences
which are thus expressed are of absolute authority,
no matter how they may be interpreted. That I
have a body, or am a body, is not to be speculatively argued
away. That I move my arm to strike the man who
has offended me, or stretch out my hand to seize the fruit
which I see, is unquestionable; that these movements
are determined by these feelings, and are never thus
effected unless thus determined, is also unquestionable.
Here are two sets of phenomena, having well-marked
differences of aspect; and they are grouped respectively
under two general heads, Life and Mind. Life is assigned
to the physical organism, or Body—all its phenomena
are objective. Mind is assigned to the psychical
organism, or Soul—all its phenomena are subjective.
Although what is called my Body is shown to be a group
of qualities which are feelings—its color, form, solidity,
position, motion—all its physical attributes being what
is felt by us in consequence of the laws of our organization;
yet inasmuch as these feelings have the characteristic
marks of objectivity, and are thereby referred to
some objective existence, we draw a broad line of demarcation
between them and other feelings having the characteristic
marks of subjectivity, and referring to ourselves
as subjects. Psychological analysis shows us that this
line of demarcation is artificial, only representing a diversity
of aspect; but as such it is indispensable to science.
We cannot really separate in a sensation what
is objective from what is subjective, and say how much
belongs to the Cosmos apart from Sensibility, and how
much to the subject pure and simple; we can only view
the sensation alternately in its objective and subjective
aspects. What belongs to extra-mental existence in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
phenomenon of Color, and what to the “greeting of the
spirit,” is utterly beyond human knowledge: for the ethereal
undulations which physicists presuppose as the cosmic
condition are themselves subjected to this same
greeting of the spirit: they too are ideal forms of sensible
experiences.</p>

<p>10. This conclusion, however, was very slowly reached.
The distinction of aspects was made the ground of a corresponding
distinction in agencies. Each group was personified
and isolated. The one group was personified in
Spirit—an existent in every respect opposed to Matter,
which was the existent represented in the other group.
One was said to be simple, indestructible; the other compound,
destructible. One was invisible, impalpable, beyond
the grasp of Sense; the other was visible, tangible,
sensible. One was of heaven, the other of earth. Thus
a biological Dualism, analogous to the cosmological, replaced
the First Notion. It was undermined by advances
in two directions. Psychology began to disclose that our
conception of Matter was, to say the least, <i>saturated</i> with
Mind, its Atoms confessedly being ideal figments; and that
all the terms by which we expressed <i>material qualities</i>
were terms which expressed <i>modes of Feeling</i>; so that
whatever remained over and above this was the unknown
<i>x</i>, which speculation required as a postulate. Idealism,
rejecting this postulate, declared that Matter was simply
the projection of Mind, and that our Body was the objectivation
of our Soul. Physiology began to disclose that
all the mental processes were (mathematically speaking)
<i>functions</i> of physical processes, i. e. varying with the variations
of bodily states; and this was declared enough to
banish forever the conception of a Soul, except as a term
simply expressing certain functions.</p>

<p>11. Idealism and Materialism are equally destructive
of Dualism. The defects of particular idealist and materialist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
theories we will not here touch upon; they mainly
result from defects of Method. Not sufficiently recognizing
the primary fact testified by Consciousness, namely,
that Experience expresses both physical and mental
aspects, and that a Not-Self is everywhere indissolubly
interwoven with Self, an objective factor with a subjective
factor, the idealist reduces Existence to a mere panorama
of mental states, and the Body to a group in this panorama.
He is thus incapable of giving a satisfactory explanation
of all the objective phenomena which do not
follow in the same order as his feelings, which manifest a
succession unlike his expectation, and which he cannot
class under the order of his mental states hitherto experienced.
He conceives that it is the Mind which <i>prescribes</i>
the order in Things; whereas experience assures
us that the order is <i>described</i>, not prescribed by us: described
in terms of Feeling, but determined by the laws
of Things, i. e. the genesis of subjective phenomena is
determined by the action of the Cosmos on our Sensibility,
and the reaction of our Sensibility. He overlooks
the evidence that the mental forms or laws of thought
which determine the character of particular experiences,
were themselves evolved through a continual action and
reaction of the Cosmos and the Soul, precisely as the laws
of organic action which determine the character of particular
functions were evolved through a continual adaptation
of the organism to the medium. These immanent
laws are declared to be transcendental, antecedent to all
such action and reaction.</p>

<p>A similar exclusiveness vitiates the materialist doctrine.
Overlooking the primary fact that Feeling is indissolubly
interwoven with processes regarded as purely physical
because they are considered solely in their objective aspect,
the materialist fails to recognize the operation of
psychological laws in the determination of physiological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
results; he hopes to reduce Biology to a problem of Mechanics.
But Vitality and Sensibility are coefficients
which must render the mechanical problem insoluble, if
only on the ground that mechanical principles have reference
to quantitative relations, whereas vital relations are
qualitative. His error is the obverse of the vitalist’s
error. The vitalist imagines that the speciality of organic
phenomena proves the existence of a cause which has no
community with the forces operating elsewhere; so, turning
his back on all the evidence, he attempts to explain
organic phenomena without any aid from Physics and
Chemistry. The materialist, turning his back on all the
evidence of quite special conditions only found at work
in living organisms, tries to explain the problem solely by
the aid of Physics and Chemistry. It is quite certain
that physiological and psychological problems are not to
be solved if we disregard the laws of Evolution through
Epigenesis. The mental structure is evolved, as the physical
structure is evolved. It is quite certain that no such
evolution is visible in anorganisms, nor will any one suppose
it to be possible in machines. From the biological
point of view we must therefore reject both Idealism and
Materialism. We applaud the one when it says, “Don’t
confuse mental facts by the introduction of physical hypotheses”;
and the other when it says, “Don’t darken
physical facts with metaphysical mists.” We say to both,
“By all means make clear to yourselves which aspect of
the phenomena you are dealing with, and express each in
its own terms. But in endeavoring to understand a phenomenon
you must take into account all its ascertainable
conditions. Now these conditions are sometimes only
approachable from the objective side; at other times only
from the subjective side.”</p>

<p>12. While it is necessary to keep the investigation of a
process on its objective side, limited to objective conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
and to express the result in objective terms, we must
remember that this is an artifice; above all, we must remember
that even within the objective limits our analyses
are only provisional, and must be finally rectified by a
restoration of all the elements we have provisionally set
aside. Thus rectified, the objective interpretation of vital
and mental phenomena has the incomparable advantage
of simplifying research, keeping it fixed on physical processes,
instead of being perturbed by suggestions of metaphysical
processes. And as all physical investigation
naturally tends to reduce itself to a mechanical investigation,
because Mechanics is the science of motion, and all
physical processes are motions, we may be asked, Why
should not the mechanical point of view be the rational
standing-point of the biologist? Our answer is, Because
Mechanics concerns itself with abstract relations, and
treats of products without reference to modes of production,
i. e. with motions without reference to all the conditions
on which they depend. Every physical change,
if expressed in physical terms, is a change of position,
and is determined by some preceding change of position.
It is a movement having a certain velocity and direction,
which velocity and direction are determined by the velocity
and direction of a force (a pressure or a tension)
compounded with the forces of resistance, i. e. counter-pressures.
Clearly, the nature of the forces in operation
must be taken into account; and it is this which the
mechanical view disregards, the biological regards. The
mechanical view is fixed on the ascertained adjustment of
the parts, so that the working of the organism may be explained
as if it were a machine, a movement here liberating
a movement there. The biological view includes this
adjustment of parts, but takes in also the conditions of
molecular change in the parts on which the adjustment
dynamically depends. Mechanical actions may be expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
as the enlargement or diminution of the angle of
two levers; but chemical actions are not thus expressible;
still less vital and mental actions.</p>

<p>13. The organism is on the physical side a mechanism,
and so long as the mechanical interpretation of organic
phenomena is confined to expressing the mechanical principles
involved in the mechanical relations, it is eminently
to be applauded. But the organism is something
more than a mechanism, even on the physical side; or,
since this statement may be misunderstood, let me say,
what no one will dispute, that the organism is a mechanism
of a very special kind, in many cardinal points unlike
all machines. This difference of kind brings with it a
difference of causal conditions. In so far as the actions
of this mechanism are those of a dependent sequence of
material positions, they are actions expressible in mechanical
terms; but in so far as these actions are dependent
on vital processes, they are not expressible in mechanical
terms. Vital facts, especially facts of sensibility, have
factors neither discernible in machines nor expressible in
mechanical terms. We cannot ignore them, although for
analytical purposes we may provisionally set them aside.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the course of the development of the mechanical
theory, the history of which has just been briefly
sketched, biological problems have more and more come
under its influence. There has always been a fierce resistance
to the attempt to explain vital and sentient
phenomena on mechanical, or even physical principles,
but still the question has incessantly recurred, How far
is the organism mechanically interpretable? And while
the progress of Biology has shown more and more the
machine-like adjustment of the several parts of which
the organism is composed, it has also shown more and
more the intervention of conditions not mechanically interpretable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
We shall have to consider the question,
therefore, under two forms. First, whether animals are
machines, and if not, by what characters do we distinguish
them from machines? Secondly, in what sense
can we correctly speak of Feeling as an agent in organic
processes?</p>

<span class="subhead">THE VITAL MECHANISM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>14. <span class="firstword">No</span> answer can be successfully attempted in reply
to the first of the questions which closed the last chapter
until we have given precision to certain terms of incessant
recurrence. I have often to remark on the peculiar
misfortune of Psychology, that all its principal terms are
employed by different writers, and are understood by different
readers, in widely different senses: they denote and
connote meanings of various significance. All physicists
mean the same thing when they speak of weight, mass,
momentum, electricity, heat, etc. All chemists mean the
same thing when they speak of affinity, decomposition,
oxygen, carbonic acid, etc. All physiologists mean the
same thing when they speak of muscle, nerve, nutrition,
secretion, etc. But scarcely any two psychologists mean
precisely the same thing when they speak of sensation,
feeling, thought, volition, consciousness, etc.; and the differences
of denotation and connotation in their uses of such
terms lead to endless misunderstanding. As Rousseau
says: “Les définitions pourraient être bonnes si l’on n’employait
pas les mots pour les faire.” But since we must
employ words as our signs, our utmost care should be
given to clearly marking what it is the signs signify.</p>

<p>15. The question we have now before us, whether animal
actions are interpretable on purely mechanical principles?
can only be answered after a preliminary settlement
of the terms. The first of these terms to be settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
is that of mechanism, when applied to the vital organism.
If the organism is a mechanism, its actions must of
course be interpretable on mechanical principles. But
this general truth requires a special interpretation, if on
inquiry we find that the organism is a particular kind
of mechanism, one which is <i>not</i> to be classed under the
same head as inorganic machines. And this we do find.
In Problem I. § <a href="#I_22">22</a>, will be found a statement of the
radical difference between organic and inorganic mechanisms,
due to the differences in their structures. But the
differences there noted do not affect the operation of abstract
mechanical principles, which are of course manifested
<i>wherever</i> there is a dependent sequence of material
changes; and which are the same abstract principles in the
mechanism of the heavens, the mechanism of a paper-mill,
or the mechanism of an animal body. In other
words, the principles are abstract, and are abstracted from
all concrete cases by letting drop what is special to each
case, retaining only what is common to all. This procedure
is indispensable to the ideal constructions of Science.
But we cannot rightly interpret any concrete case by abstract
principles alone; we must restore the special
characters which the abstraction has eliminated. The
most lucid explanation of the mechanism of the heavens
will leave us quite in the dark respecting the action of a
paper-mill, until we have studied the mill at work, ascertained
its structure and mode of operation, and therein
detected what is common both to its mechanism and to the
mechanism of the heavens. Thus equipped, we approach
the study of the animal mechanism, but find ourselves
wholly in the dark until we have also ascertained its
structure and mode of operation; then we may recognize
in it the principles of dependent sequence which had
been abstracted from the paper-mill and the heavens.
To neglect this concrete study, and to argue from Machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
to Life in disregard of special conditions, is not
more rational than to assume that the movement of a
piston is prompted by volition.</p>

<p id="II_16">16. The recognition of special differences is no denial
of fundamental identities. We do not deny the presence
of phenomena in organisms which belong to physical and
chemical agencies, but we assert that organisms have
other phenomena besides these, dependent on conditions
not present in physical and chemical phenomena. The
same material elements and forces may be recognized in
a moving inorganic body, and a moving organic body; but
in the latter there is a speciality of combination with a
speciality of result. Just as the same words and laws of
grammatical construction may be recognized in prose and
poetry; yet poetry is not prose, but has special rules of
its own, and special effects. In an organism, as in a
machine, the adjustment of the parts is a condition of
the mechanical action; the one enables us to explain the
other. But the parts adjusted, and the consequences of
the adjustment, are unlike in the two cases. This unlikeness
is pervading and profound. One cardinal difference
is that the combination of the parts is in the machine a
fixed, in the organism a fluctuating adjustment; and this
fluctuation is due to certain vital processes subjectively
known as <i>sensitive guidance</i>. Hence machines have fixed
and calculated mechanisms; whereas organisms are variable
and to a great extent incalculable mechanisms.</p>

<p>17. I conceive, therefore, that a theory which reduces
vital activities to purely physical processes is self-condemned.
Not that we are to admit the agency of any
extra-organic principle, such as the hypothesis of Vitalism
assumes (Prob. I. § <a href="#I_14">14</a>); but only the agency of an
intra-organic principle, or the abstract symbol of <i>all</i> the
co-operant conditions—the special combination of forces
which result in organization. This assures us that an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
organism is a peculiar kind of mechanism, the processes in
which are peculiar to it; and among those processes there
is one which results in what we call Sensibility. This
Sensibility is a factor which raises the phenomena into
another order. To overlook its presence is fatal to any
explanation of the organic mechanism. Yet it is overlooked
by those who tell us that when an impression on
a nerve is conveyed to the brain, and is thence reflected
on the limbs—as when the retina of a wolf is stimulated
by the image of a sheep, and the spring of the wolf upon
the sheep follows as a “purely mechanical consequence—the
whole process has from first to last been physical.”
Unless the term <i>physical</i> is here used to designate the
<i>objective sequence</i>, as contemplated by an onlooker, who
likens the process to the sequence observable in a machine,
I should say that from first to last the process has
been <i>not</i> physical, but <i>vital</i>, involving among its essential
conditions the peculiarly vital factor named Sensibility.
The process taking place in the wolf’s organism is one
which involves conditions never found in purely physical
processes. We may indeed analytically disregard these.
We may view the process in its purely physical relations,
or in its purely chemical relations, or in its purely mathematical
(mechanical) relations. But this is the artifice of
the analytical method. In reality the process is no one
of these, for it is all of these; it is a process in a living
organism, and depends on conditions only found in living
organisms—nay, in this particular case the process depends
on conditions only found in organisms like that of
the wolf; for the image of the sheep will stimulate the
brain of a goat, horse, or elephant without producing any
such movement in the organism.</p>

<p>18. The importance of this point must excuse my reiteration
of it. We must make clear to ourselves that
the organism is in its objective aspect a physiological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
mechanism, in its subjective aspect a psychological mechanism:
in both aspects it is to be radically demarcated
from all inorganic mechanisms. In it the combination
and co-ordination of movements involve conditions never
present in machines; among these conditions, there are
combinations and co-ordinations of Sensibility, which,
although material processes on the objective side, are
processes believed to be only present in organisms. We
have the strongest reasons for concluding that every feeling,
every change in Sensibility, has its correlative material
process in the organism—is, in short, only the
subjective aspect of the objective organic change. What
in Physiology is called Co-ordination and has reference
to movements, in Psychology may be called Logic, having
reference to feelings. But be this latter point accepted
or rejected, the one point which admits of no dispute is
that an organism is radically distinguishable from every
inorganic mechanism in that <i>it acquires through the very
exercise of its primary constitution, a new constitution with
new powers</i>. Its adjustment is a changing and developing
mechanism. That is to say, a machine, however complex
its structure, is constructed once for all, and this primary
constitution is final, the adjustment of parts remaining
unaltered; and although by exercise the machine may
come to work more easily, with less friction, it never
comes to work differently, to <i>readjust</i> its parts, and develop
new capabilities. It has no <i>historical</i> factor manifest in
its functions. It has no experience. It reacts at last as
at first. How different the organism! This has not only
variable adjustments due to internal fluctuations, it has
experience which develops new parts, and new adjustments
of old parts. Every organism has its <i>primary</i> constitution
in the adjustment of parts peculiar to the species;
it has also its <i>secondary</i> or modified constitution, in
the adjustment which has been more or less altered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
individual experiences; it has, thirdly, its <i>temporary</i> constitution
in the variable adjustment due to the varying
state of tension which results from varying stimulation.</p>

<p>19. A word on each. There is a structural disposition
of the parts which is common to large groups of organisms,
so that a corresponding similarity is observable in
the reactions of these organisms. Thus all quadrupeds
use their limbs for locomotion in very similar ways; birds
use their wings for flight in similar ways. All vertebrates
swallow their food, defend themselves, shrink when hurt,
etc., in ways that are very similar. In so far as their
organizations are alike, their actions and reactions are
alike. In so far as their organizations differ, their actions
and reactions differ. The goose and the vulture are alike
in the main lines of structure; still more alike are duck
and hen; yet, owing to certain unlike characters of structure,
they manifest some marked differences in action and
reaction: the goose will starve in the presence of food
which the vulture gluttonously devours, and the vulture
will refuse the vegetable food which the goose devours;
the duck plunges into the water, the hen not only refuses
to enter it, but is greatly agitated when she sees the ducklings
she has hatched plunging into it. That peculiar
instincts, habits, and feelings are rigorously determined
by peculiarities in the organism, no one doubts, when
animals are in question. If this is less obvious in the
case of men, the reason is that there the influence of other
factors somewhat masks the operation of the primary constitution—these
factors are the modified and the temporary
constitutions. Yet even in man it is true to say
that his feelings and actions are the result of his organization,
native and acquired.</p>

<p id="II_20">20. No two men are organized in all respects alike.
There are individual variations in structure, both native
and acquired. These may be too slight to be appreciable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
by any other test than the difference of reaction under similar
external stimuli; but the variations in the sensibility
to music, color, temperature, sexual influence, moral influence,
etc., betray corresponding differences in the organisms.
Any one variation in structure, seemingly trivial,
may be the origin of well-marked diversity in physical
and moral characters. Compare the bull with the ox, or
the predatory aggressive eagle with the cowardly vulture.
Nor are the temporary modifications to be overlooked.
Antoine Cros mentions the case of a patient, a young girl,
suffering from congested liver and spleen, which of course
altered the state of her blood, and thus for a time modified
her constitution. Her moral character was greatly
altered by it. She ceased to feel any affection for father
or mother; would play with her doll, but could not
be brought to show any delight in it; could not be
drawn out of her apathetic sadness. Things which previously
had made her shriek with laughter, now left her
uninterested. Her temper changed, became capricious
and violent.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Congestion of the lungs, if unaccompanied
by congestion of the liver, never produces such effects, because
not thus altering the blood. The effects of liver
congestion are familiar. Cros cites the case of a magistrate
whose liver was enlarged, and whose skin showed a
markedly bilious aspect, and in whom all affection seemed
to be dead: he did not exhibit any perversion or violence,
only want of emotive reaction. If he went to the theatre
he could not feel the slightest pleasure in it. The thoughts
of his home, his absent wife and children, were, he declared,
as unaffecting to him as a problem in Euclid.</p>

<p>21. Owing to the recognized dependence of peculiar instincts
and modes of reaction on peculiarities of structure,
comparative anatomists are quite confident, when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
find a portion of a skull with two occipital condyles, that
the animal to which this skull belonged had red blood-corpuscles
without nuclei, and (if a female) suckled its
young. If in that fragment of skull there remain a single
tooth, it will prove that the animal was carnivorous or
herbivorous, and had, or had not, retractile claws. From
such data a general conclusion may be formed as to
the instincts and habits of the animal. The data disclose
much of the primary constitution, that is to say,
the mechanism which the animal brought with it into the
world, ready prepared to react in definite ways on being
stimulated. The connate mechanism has correlative tendencies
of reaction. Some of these tendencies are inevitably
called into play by external conditions, and they
continue unaltered amid great varieties of circumstances,
provided none of these variations directly deprive them
of their appropriate stimulation. Such tendencies of the
connate mechanism are styled <i>automatic</i> (an unfortunate
metaphor, which has led to the theory of Automatism),
and include, besides the visceral reactions, the more complex
reactions of winking, breathing, swallowing, coughing,
flying, walking, etc. It is true that we learn to walk,
and learn to wink, whereas the other actions require no
tentative efforts directed by experience; but the mechanism
of all these actions is already laid down in the primary
constitution, and is inevitably called into play.</p>

<p>22. The instincts also belong to the connate mechanism,
and in the course of the normal experience of the
animal inevitably come into play; but, unlike the automatic
tendencies of breathing, swallowing, and coughing,
they are capable of modification, or even suppression, by
alterations in the course of individual experience. The
connate mechanism of the cat determines its dread of
water, and its enmity to the dog and mouse; yet a cat
will by the modifications of certain experiences become as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
ready as an otter to take to the water, and become so
fond of a dog that she will allow him to tend upon her
kittens; and so indifferent to the mouse that she will let
it run over her body. All this implies a new adjustment
in the nervous centres, with new modes of reaction on
sensory impressions: the inherited mechanism has been
modified. I need not dwell on the profound modifications
which the human inherited mechanism undergoes
in the course of experience—how social influences and
moral and religious teachings redirect, or even suppress,
many primary tendencies; so that “moral habits” become
organized, and replace the original tendencies of the organism.
These, when organized, become the inevitable modes
of reaction, and are sometimes called secondarily automatic.
It is important to recognize this organization of
experiences, this acquisition of a secondary or modified
constitution, if we would explain psychological processes
by physiological processes. Thus the processes of Logic
are automatic, they belong to the connate primary mechanism,
and their action is inevitable, invariable. The
elements of a judgment, like the elements of a perception,
may vary, and we therefore say that one judgment is
false, and one perception incomplete; but the judging
process is always the same, and the perceiving process is
always the same. We may breathe pure air or impure
air, but the breathing process is in each case the same;
and judgment is as automatic as breathing, not to be
altered, not to be suppressed. Again, the moral terror at
wickedness of any recognized kind is as automatic as the
instinctive terror at danger. The one has its roots in
the primary disposition called love of approbation and its
correlative dread of disapprobation: the social instinct.
The other has its root in the primary disposition called
“instinct of self-preservation,” which is really the reflex
shrinking from pain: the physiological instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
23. Besides the connate and acquired mechanism, we
have now to consider the temporary and fluctuating adjustments
which represent the statical condition of the
organism at each moment. The automatism of the primary
constitution is such that previous experience and
conscious effort are not needed; nor will any experience
or any effort alter the mode of reaction. If a strong
light falls on the eye, the iris contracts; if the eyeball
is dry, the eyelid drops; if sound-waves beat upon the
tympanum, the stapedius muscle contracts; if the lining
of the throat be tickled, the muscles involved in
coughing or in vomiting contract. No experience is
necessary for these actions, some of which are so complicated
that if we had to learn them, as we learn far
simpler actions, the organism would perish before the
power was attained. Yet all of these presuppose a certain
normal state of the mechanism, any considerable
variation in which will modify or suppress them.</p>

<p>24. Secondarily automatic actions are those which have
been acquired through experiences that have modified
the organism, and produced a new adjustment of parts.
We learn to shield the eyes against a strong glare of light
by raising the hand; by winking we learn to shield the
eye against an approaching body; we also learn to turn
the head in the direction of a sound, and to thrust away
with our hands the object that is irritating our skin.
Experience has been necessary for all these actions, and
has finally organized the tendencies to perform them, so
that the reaction is invariable, inevitable, unless controlled
by the will. If you tickle my throat, I may, or may
not, push aside your hand; but if the inside of my throat
be tickled, I must cough. Here we see the difference
between the automatic and secondarily automatic actions.
The second being due to individual experience, are more
or less controllable; and whether they are or are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
controlled depends on the condition of the nerve-centres
at the moment. You may tickle my throat, or irritate
my skin, without causing any movement of my hands to
thwart you, either because my nerve-centres are preoccupied
by other stimulations, and I am not conscious of
the irritation, or because I do not choose to thwart you.</p>

<p>25. It should be added that some secondarily automatic
actions have become so firmly organized that we
can only with great difficulty interfere with them. Others
never enter into consciousness, and are therefore often
supposed to be purely mechanical. The movement of
the eye towards the brightest light, and the convergence
of the axes of both eyes, are reflexes which, although
involuntary and unconscious, are the products of education.
They do not belong to the connate constitution,
although they are so inevitably acquired by experience
that they belong to every normal child. At first the
infant stares with a blank gaze, and its eyes, though moving
under the stimulus of light, move incoherently; the
axes never converge except by accident. Very early,
however, the infant’s eyes are observed to follow the
movements of a bright light; and at last they acquire so
certain and rapid a power of adjustment that the eyes
shift from spot to spot, always “fixing” the object by
bringing the most sensitive part of the retina to bear on
it. The incoherent movements have become precisely
regulated movements. It is the same with speech. The
vocal organs are exercised in an incoherent babble. By
degrees these movements become regulated so as to respond
definitely to definite stimuli, and words are formed,
then sentences, till finally fluent speech becomes in a
great degree automatic. The vocal muscles respond to
an auditory stimulus, and the child repeats the word it
has heard, just as the eye-muscles respond to a retinal
stimulus. That we acquire the power of converging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
axes, and accommodating the lens to near objects, is not
only proved by observation of infants, but also by cases
of disease. After the reflex mechanism has been long
established, so that it acts with inevitable precision, a
slight paralysis of one of the muscles has the effect of
making all objects appear in a different position; the
patient trying to touch an object, then always moves his
hand on one side of it. Von Graefe relates the case of
a stonebreaker who always struck his hand with the
hammer when he tried to strike the stone. Yet this
very man <i>learned</i> to accommodate his movements to the
new impressions; so that if his paralysis had been cured,
his modified mechanism would have been ill adapted to
the new conditions, and he would once more have struck
his hand instead of the stone.</p>

<p>26. This digression on the native and acquired dispositions
of the organism, while it has brought into strong
light all that can be cited in favor of regarding animal
bodies as mechanisms, and their actions as the direct consequences
of mechanical adjustments, has also made conspicuous
the radical difference between an organism and a
machine. We cannot too emphatically insist on this radical
difference. Between the group of conditions involved
in the structure and action of a machine, and the group
of conditions involved in the structure and action of an
organism, there are contrasts as broad as any that can
be named. To overlook these in taking account solely
of the conditions common to both groups is a serious
error. On such grounds we might insist that a tiger is a
violet, because both are organisms.</p>

<p>The biologist will admit that an organism is a mechanism,
and (in so far as its bodily structure is concerned) a
material mechanism. All the actions of this structure
are therefore mechanical, in the two senses of the term:
first, as being the actions of material adjustments; secondly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
as being movements, and thereby included under
the general laws of motion represented in Mechanics;
the abstract laws of movement for an organic body are
not different from the abstract laws of movement for an
inorganic body. So far we have been considering the
abstract relations only. No sooner do we consider the
phenomena as concrete wholes, than we find great diversity
in the modes of production of the movements in
organisms and machines. Now it is precisely the modes
of production which have interest for us. We never
understand a phenomenon so as to gain any practical
control over it, or any theoretical illumination from it,
unless we have mastered some of its conditions; our
knowledge of these conditions is the measure of our
power.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RELATION OF BODY AND MIND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>27. <span class="firstword">The</span> second question proposed was, In what sense
can Feeling be correctly spoken of as an Agent in organic
processes? This brings us face to face with a much-debated
topic, the relation of Body and Mind; and demands
a theoretic interpretation of that First Notion
which expresses universal experience, namely, that what
I know as Myself is a Body, in one aspect, and a Soul, in
the other. What I call my Body is a persistent aggregate
of objective phenomena; and my Soul is a persistent
aggregate of subjective phenomena: the one is an individualized
group of experiences expressible in terms of
Matter and Motion, and therefore designated <i>physical</i>; the
other an individualized group of experiences expressible
in terms of Feeling, and therefore designated <i>psychical</i>.
But, however contrasted, they are both simply embodiments
of Experience, that is to say, are Modes of Feeling.
All Existence—as known to us—is the Felt. The laws
of our organism compel us, indeed, to postulate an Existent
which is <i>extra mentem</i>—a Real not Ourselves—but
the same laws debar us from any knowledge whatever of
what this <i>is</i>, or is <i>like</i>. We know Things absolutely <i>in
so far</i> as they exist in relation to us; and that is the
only knowledge which can have any possible significance
for us.</p>

<p>28. It is impossible for me to doubt that I am a Body,
though I may doubt whether what is thus called is anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
more than a group of feelings. It is impossible
for me to doubt that I am a Soul; though I may doubt
whether what is thus called is more than a group of
bodily functions. In separating what is unquestionable
from what is questionable, we separate the fundamental
facts of consciousness from the theoretic interpretations
of those facts: no theoretic interpretation can efface or
alter the facts. Whatever Philosophy may discover, it
cannot displace the fact that I know I am a Soul, <i>in every
sense in which that phrase represents Experience</i>: I know
the Soul in knowing its concretes (feelings), and in knowing
it as an abstraction which condenses those concretes
in a symbol. The secondary question is, Whether this
abstraction represents one Existent, and the abstraction
Body another and wholly different Existent, or the two
abstractions represent only two different Aspects? this
may be debated, and must be answered according to theoretic
probabilities.</p>

<p>29. What are the probabilities? We are all agreed
that Consciousness is the final arbiter. Its primary deliverance
is simply that of <i>a</i> radical distinction. It is
silent on the nature of the distinction—says nothing as
to whether the distinction is one of agents or of aspects.
It says, “I am a Soul.” With equal clearness it says, “I
am a Body.” It does <i>not</i> say, “I am two things.” Nor
does the fact of a radical distinction imply more than a
contrast of aspects, such as that of convex and concave.
The curve has at every point this contrast of convex and
concave, and yet is the identical line throughout. A
mental process is at every point contrasted with the
physical process assumed to be its correlate; and this
contrast demands equivalent expression in the terms of
each. The identity underlying the two aspects of the
curve is evident to Sense. The identity underlying the
mental and physical process is not evident to Sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
but may be made eminently <i>probable</i> to Speculation,
especially when we have explained the grounds of the
difference, namely, that they are apprehended through
different modes. But although I admit that the conclusion
is only one of probability, it is one which greatly
transcends the probability of any counter-hypothesis.
Let us see how this can be made out.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>30. We start from the position that a broad line of
demarcation must be drawn between the mental and the
physical aspect of a process, supposing them to be identical
in reality. Nothing can be more <i>unlike</i> a logical
proposition than the physical process which is its correlate;
so that Philosophy has hitherto been forced to
forego every attempt at an explanation of how the two
can be causally connected: referring the connection to a
mystery, or invoking two different agents, spiritual and
material, moving on parallel lines, like two clocks regulated
to work simultaneously. But having recognized
this difference, can we not also discern fundamental resemblances?
First and foremost, we note that there is
common to both the basis in Feeling: they are both modes
of Consciousness. The Mind thinking the logical proposition
is not, indeed, in the same <i>state</i> as the Mind picturing
the physical process which is the correlate of that
logical proposition—no more than I, who see you move
on being struck, have the same feelings as you who are
struck. But the Mind which pictures the logical proposition
as a process, and pictures the physical process as a
bodily change, is contemplating one and the same event
under its subjective and objective aspects; just as when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
picture to myself the feelings you experience on being
struck I separate the subjective aspect of the blow from
its objective aspect. Secondly, between the logical proposition
and the physical process there is a community of
causal dependence, i. e. the mode of grouping of the
constituent elements, whereby this proposition, and not
another, is the result of this grouping, and not another.
In fact, what in subjective terms is called Logic, in objective
terms is Grouping.</p>

<p>31. Let us approach the question on a more accessible
side. Sensation avowedly lies at the basis of mental
manifestations. Now, rightly or wrongly, Sensation is
viewed alternately as a purely subjective fact—a psychological
process—and as a purely objective fact—the
physiological reaction of a sense-organ. It is so conspicuously
a physiological process that many writers
exclude it from the domain of Mind, assign it to the
material organism, and believe that it is explicable on
purely mechanical principles. This seems to me eminently
disputable; but the point is noticed in proof of
the well-marked objective character which the phenomenon
assumes. In this aspect a sensation is simply the
reaction of a bodily organ. The physiologist describes
how a stimulus excites the organ, and declares its reaction
to be the sensation. Thus viewed, and expressed in terms
of Matter and Motion, there is absolutely nothing of that
subjective quality which characterizes sensation. Yet
without this quality the objective process cannot be a
sensation. Exclude Feeling, and the excitation of the
auditory organ will no more yield the sensation of Sound
by its reaction, than the strings and sounding-board of
a piano when the keys are struck will yield music to a
deaf spectator. Hence the natural inference has been that
inside the organism there is a <i>listener</i>: the Soul is said to
listen, transforming excitation into sensation. This inference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
only needs a more systematic interpretation and it
will represent the biological theory, which demands something
<i>more</i> than the reaction of the sensory organ—namely,
the reaction of the whole organism <i>through</i> the
sensory organ. I mean, that no organ isolated from the
organism is capable of a <i>physiological</i> reaction—only
of a physico-chemical reaction; and sensation depends
on (<i>is</i>) the physiological reaction. When a sense-organ is
stimulated, this stimulation is a vital process, and is raised
out of the class of physico-chemical processes by virtue
of its being the indissoluble part of a complex whole.
Interfere with any one of the co-operant conditions—withdraw
the circulation, check respiration, disturb secretion—and
the sense-organ sinks from the physiological
to the physical state; it may then be brought into
contact with its normal stimuli, but no stimulation (in
the vital sense) will take place, there will be no vital
reaction.</p>

<p>Condensing all vital processes in the symbol Vitality,
we may say Vitality is requisite for every physiological
process. A parallelism may be noted on the subjective
side: all the sentient processes may be condensed in the
one symbol Sensibility (Feeling), and we must then say,
No psychological process is possible as an isolated fact,
but demands the co-operation of others—it is a <i>resultant</i>
of all the contemporaneous conditions of Sensibility in
the organism. In ordinary language this is what is meant
by saying that no impression can become a sensation
without the intervention of Consciousness—an ambiguous
phrase, because of the ambiguity of the term Consciousness,
but the phrase expresses the fact that in
Sensation a process in the organism is necessary to the
reaction of the organ.</p>

<p>32. Having recognized the distinction between the two
processes objective and subjective, physical and mental,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
we have recognized the vanity of attempting to assign
their limits, and to say where Motion ends and Feeling
begins, or how Feeling again changes into Motion. The
one does <i>not</i> begin where the other ends. According to
the two-clock theory of Dualism, the two <i>agents</i> move on
parallel lines. On the theory of Monism the two <i>aspects</i>
are throughout opposed. Both theories explain the facts;
which explanation is the most congruous with experience?
Against the first we may object that the hypothesis of two
Agents utterly unallied in nature wants the cardinal character
of a fertile hypothesis in its unverifiableness: it
may be true, we can never know that it is true. By the
very terms of its definition, the Spirit—if that mean
<i>more</i> than an abstract expression of sentient states—is
beyond all sensible experience. This is indeed admitted
by the dualists, for they postulate a Spirit merely because
they cannot otherwise explain the phenomena of Consciousness.
Herein they fail to see that even their postulate
brings no explanation, it merely restates the old
problem in other terms.</p>

<p>33. Up to the present time these same objections might
have been urged with equal force against Monism. Indeed,
although many philosophers have rejected the two-clock
theory of Leibnitz, they have gained a very hesitating
acceptance for their own hypothesis of identity. To
most minds the difficulty of imagining how a physical
process could <i>also</i> be a psychical process, a movement also
be a feeling, seemed not less than that of imagining how
two such distinct Agents as Matter and Mind could co-operate,
and react on each other, or move simultaneously
on parallel lines. Although for many years I have accepted
the hypothesis of Monism, I have always recognized
its want of an adequate reply to such objections.
Unless I greatly deceive myself, I have now found a solution
of the main difficulty; and found it in psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
conditions which are perfectly intelligible. But knowing
how easily one may deceive one’s self in such matters, I
will only ask the reader to meditate with open-mindedness
the considerations now to be laid before him, and see
if he can feel the same confidence in their validity.</p>

<p>34. One of the early stages in the development of Experience
is the separation of Self from the Not-Self. I look
out on “the vast extern of things,” and see a great variety
of objects, included in a visible hemisphere. All these
objects in various positions, having various forms and colors,
I believe to be wholly detached from, and in every
way unallied to, Myself. And what is that Self? It is
my Body as a visible and tangible object, separated from
all other visible and tangible objects by the constant presence
of feelings connected with it and its movements, and
not connected with the other objects. This constant presence
of feelings is referred to a Soul, which I then separate
from my Body, as an Inner Self; and from this time
onwards I speak of the Body as <i>mine</i>, and learn to regard
it in much the same light as other outer objects. In my
naïve judgment the external objects are supposed to exist
<i>as</i> I see and touch them, whether I or any one else see
and touch them or not: they in no sense belong to the
series of feelings which constitute the Me. And since
my Body resembles these objects in visible and tangible
qualities, and also in being external to my feelings, it also
takes its place in the objective world. Thus arises the
hypothesis of Dualism which postulates a <i>Physis</i>, or object-world,
and an <i>Æsthesis</i>, or subject-world: two independent
existents, one contemplated, the other contemplating.</p>

<p>35. Philosophy, as we know, leads to a complete
reversal of this primitive conclusion, and shows that the
<i>contemplated</i> is a <i>synthesis of contemplations</i>, the Physis being
<i>also</i> the Æsthesis. Psychological investigation shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
that the objects supposed to <i>have</i> forms, colors, and positions
within an external hemisphere, have these only in
virtue of the very feelings from which they are supposed
to be separated. The <i>visible</i> universe exists only <i>as seen</i>:
the objects are Reals conditioned by the laws of Sensibility.
The space in which we see them, their geometrical
relations, the light and shadows which reveal them,
the forms they affect, the lines of their changing directions,
the qualities which distinguish them,—all these
are but the externally projected signs of feelings. They
are signs which we interpret according to organized laws
of experience; each sign being itself a feeling connected
with other feelings. We project them outside according
to the “law of eccentric projection”—which is only the
expression of the fact that one feeling is a sign of some
other, and is thereby <i>ideally detached</i> from it. According
to this law I say, “my Body”; just as I say, “my
House”; or, “my Property.” Misled by this, Dualism
holds that in the very fact of detaching my Body from
my Self, calling it <i>mine</i>, is the revelation of a distinct
entity within the body. But that this is illusory, appears
in the application of this same law of eccentric projection
to sensations and thoughts, which are called <i>mine</i>, as my
legs and arms are mine. If it is undeniable that I say
<i>my</i> Body—and thus ideally detach the Body from the
Soul—it is equally undeniable that I say <i>my</i> Soul; and
from what is the Soul detached? In presence of this
difficulty, the metaphysician may argue that neither Body
nor Soul can be coextensive with its manifestations, but
demands a noumenal Real for each—a <i>substratum</i> for the
bodily manifestations, and a <i>substratum</i> for the mental
manifestations. This, however, is an evasion, not a solution
of the difficulty. If we postulate an unknown and
unknowable noumenon, we gain no insight: first, because
Philosophy deals only with the known functions of unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
quantities, and therefore leaves the <i>x</i> out of the
calculation; secondly, because, granting the existence of
these noumena, we can have no rational grounds for
asserting that they are not of one and the same nature;
for we have no grounds for <i>any</i> assertion whatever about
them. And if it be urged against this, that Consciousness
testifies to a distinction, I answer that on a closer
scrutiny it will be found to testify to nothing more than
a diversity of manifestation. All therefore that comes
within the range of knowledge is, How does this diversity
arise?</p>

<p>36. There are two ways, and there are only two, in
which differences arise. These are, 1°, the <i>modes of production</i>
of a product, and, 2°, our <i>modes of apprehension</i> of
the product. Things may be very different, and yet to
our apprehension indistinguishable, so that we regard
them as identical; and they may be identical, yet appear
utterly unlike. A mechanical bird may seem so like a
living bird, and their actions so indistinguishable to the
spectator, that he will not suspect a difference, or suspecting
it, will not be able to specify it. Of both objects, so
long as his modes of apprehending them are circumscribed,
he can only say what these imply: he sees familiar forms,
colors, and movements, which he interprets according to
the previous experiences of which these are the signs.
But by varying the modes of apprehension, and gaining
thus a fuller knowledge, he finds that the two products
have very different modes of production; hence he concludes
the products to be different: the mechanism of the
one is not the organism of the other; the actions of the
mechanical bird are not the actions of the living bird.
The fuller knowledge has been gained by viewing the objects
under different relations, and contemplating them <i>in</i>
their modes of production, not as merely visible products.
He sees the mechanism performing by steel springs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
wheels, and wires, the work which the organism performs
by bones, muscles, and nerves; and the farther his analysis
of the modes of production is carried, the greater are
the differences which he apprehends.</p>

<p>37. Now consider the other side. One and the same
object will necessarily present very different aspects under
different subjective conditions, since it is <i>these</i> which determine
the aspect. The object cannot be to Sight what
it is to Hearing, to Touch what it is to Smell. The vibrations
of a tuning-fork are seen as movements, heard as
sounds. In current language the vibrations are said to
cause the sounds. Misled by this, philosophers puzzle
themselves as to how a material process (vibration) can
be transformed into a mental process (sensation), how
such a cause can have so utterly different an effect. But
I have formerly<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> argued at some length that there is no
transformation or causation of the kind supposed. The
tuning-fork—or that Real which in relation to Sense is
the particular object thus named—will, by one of its
modes of acting on my Sensibility through my optical
apparatus, determine the response known as <i>vibrations</i>;
but it is not this response of the optical organ which is
transformed into, or causes the response of the auditory
organ, known as <i>sound</i>. The auditory organ knows nothing
of vibrations, the optical nothing of sounds. The
responses are both modes of Feeling determined by organic
conditions, and represent the two different relations
in which the Real is apprehended. The Real <i>is</i> alternately
the one and the other. And if the one mode of
Feeling has a physical significance, while the other has a
mental significance, so that we regard the vibrations as
objective facts, belonging to the external world, and the
sounds as subjective facts, exclusively belonging to the
internal world, this is due to certain psychological influences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
presently to be expounded. Meanwhile let us fix
clearly in our minds that both vibrations and sounds are
modes of Feeling. My consciousness plainly assures me
that it is I who see the one, and hear the other; not that
there are two distinct subjects for the two distinct feelings.
Add to which, manifold uncontradicted experiences
assure me that the occasional cause—the objective factor—of
the one feeling, is also the cause of the other, and
not that the two feelings have two different occasional
causes. From both of these undeniable facts we must
conclude that the difference felt is simply a difference
of aspect, determined by some difference in the modes of
apprehension.</p>

<p>38. Assuming then that a mental process is only another
aspect of a physical process—and this we shall
find the more probable hypothesis—we have to explain
by what influences these diametrically opposite aspects
are determined. From all that has just been said we
must seek these in the modes of apprehension. There
can be no doubt that we express the fact in very different
terms; the question is, What do these terms <i>signify</i>?
Why do we express one aspect in terms of Matter and
Motion, assigning the process to the objective world; and
the other aspect in terms of Feeling, assigning the process
to the subjective world?</p>

<p>Let the example chosen be a logical process as the
mental aspect, and a neural process as its physical correlate.
The particular proposition may be viewed logically,
as a grouping of experiences, or physiologically, as a grouping
of neural tremors. Here we have the twofold aspect of
one and the same reality; and these different aspects are
expressed in different terms. We cannot be too rigorous
in our separation of the terms; for every attentive student
must have noted how frequently discussions are made
turbid by the unconscious <i>shifting of terms</i> in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
of the argumentation. This is not only the mistake of
opponents who are unaware of the shifting which has
occurred in each other’s minds, so that practically the
adversaries do not meet on common ground, but cross
and recross each other; it is also the mistake of the solitary
thinker losing himself in the maze of interlacing conceptions
instead of keeping steadily to one path. Only
by such shifting of terms can the notion of the physical
process causing, or being transformed into, the mental
process for a moment gain credit; and this also greatly
sustains the hypothesis of Dualism, with its formidable
objections: How can Matter think? How can Mind act
on Matter causing Motion?</p>

<p>39. Those who recognized that the terms Matter and
Mind were abstractions mutually exclusive, saw at once
that these questions, instead of being formidable, were in
truth irrational. To ask if Matter could think, or Mind
move Matter, was a confusion of symbols equivalent to
speaking of a yard of Hope, and a ton of Terror. Although
Measure and Weight are symbols of Feeling, and
in <i>this</i> respect are on a par with Hope and Terror, yet
because they are objective symbols they cannot be applied
to subjective states, without violation of the very
significance they were invented to express. No one ever
asks whether a sensation of Sound can be a sensation of
Color; nor whether Color can move a machine, although
Heat can, yet the one is no less a sensation than the
other. On similar grounds no one should ask whether
Matter can think, or Mind move Matter. The only
rational question is one preserving the integrity of the
terms, namely, whether the living, thinking organism
presents itself to apprehension under the twofold aspect—now
under the modes of Feeling classified as objective
or physical; now under the modes classified as subjective
or mental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
40. We are told that it is “impossible to imagine Matter
thinking,” which is very true; only by a gross <i>confusion</i>
of terms can Thought be called a property of cerebral
tissue, or of Matter at all. We may, indeed, penetrate
beneath the terms which relate to aspects, and recognize
in the underlying reality not two existences, but one.
Our conceptions of this reality, however, are expressed in
symbols representing different classes of feelings, objective
and subjective; and to employ the terms of one class
to designate the conceptions of the other is to frustrate
the very purposes of language. Matter and Mind, Object
and Subject, are abstractions from sentient experiences.
We know them as abstractions, and know the
concrete experiences from which they are abstracted.
Philosophers, indeed, repeatedly assure us that we neither
know what Matter is nor what Mind is, we only know
the <i>phenomenal products</i> of the action and reaction of
these two unknown noumena. Were this so, all discussion
would be idle; we could not say whether Matter
was or was not capable of thinking, whether Mind was
or was not the same as Matter, we could only abstain
from saying anything whatever on the topic. What
should we reply to one who asked us to name the product
of two unknown quantities? So long as <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
without values their product must be without value. If
the value of <i>x</i> be known, and that of <i>y</i> unknown, then
the product still remains unknown: <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> + 0 = <i>x</i>.
Therefore, unless the Objective aspect were the <i>equivalent</i>
of the Subjective aspect, it could never be subjectively
present. Feeling is but another aspect of the Felt.</p>

<p>41. It is because we do know what Matter is, that we
know it is <i>not</i> Mind: they are symbols of two different
modes of Feeling. If we separate the conception of citizenship
from the conception of fatherhood, although the
same man is both citizen and father, how much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
decisively must we separate the conception of Matter,
which represents one group of feelings, from the conception
of Mind, which represents another? One element
in the former is common to the whole group, namely, the
reference to a Not-Self, induced by the sensation of Resistance,
which always ideally or sensibly accompanies
the material class. The axiom, I feel, <i>ergo</i> I exist, has
its correlative:—I act, <i>ergo</i> there are other existents on
which I act; and these are not wholly Me, for they resist,
oppose, exclude me; yet they are also one with Me,
since they are felt by me. In my Feeling, that which
is not Me is Matter, the objective aspect of the Felt, as
Mind is the subjective aspect.</p>

<p>But since Hunger and Thirst, Joy and Grief, Pain and
Terror, are also <i>felt</i>, yet are never classed under the head
of Matter, the grounds of the classification of feelings
have to be expressed. Professor Bain makes the distinction
between Matter and Mind to rest solely on the presence
or absence of Extension: this is the decisive mark:
Matter he defines as the Extended. The definition is inadequate.
When I see a dog and its image reflected in a
pool, or see a dog and think of another, in the three cases
dog, image, and idea have Extension; but I recognize the
dog as a material fact, the idea as a mental fact; and
although the image of the dog has material conditions by
which I am optically affected, just as the idea has material
cerebral conditions, I recognize a marked difference
between them and the dog, due to the different modes of
apprehension. The dog is known as a persistent reality,
which, when Sight is supplemented by Touch, will yield
sensations of Resistance, and thus disclose its materiality.
The image vanishes if I attempt to touch it; I see its
outlines waver and become confused with every disturbance
of the surface of the pool; the idea vanishes when
another idea arises; whence I conclude that neither has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
material reality, because neither has the Resistance which
characterizes the Not-Self. The image and the idea may
be referred to material conditions, but so may pains, terrors,
volitions, yet these are all without Extension, simply
because they are not visual feelings.</p>

<p>42. Matter does not represent all feelings, but only the
objective sensibles; and these are not all characterized
by Extension, but only those which directly or indirectly
involve optico-tactical experiences accompanied by muscular
experiences. Matter is primarily the Visible and
Resistant; and secondarily, whatever can be imagined as
such; so that ether, molecules, and atoms, although neither
visible nor tangible, are ranged under the head of
Matter. Color is a feeling as Sound and Scent are feelings,
and although material conditions are equally presupposed
in all three, yet Color alone has Extension, and because
it can be imaged it has a more objective character
than the others, which having no lines and surfaces, want
the optical conditions for the formation of images, and are
less definitely connected with tactical and muscular experiences.
Nevertheless, since Sound and Scent are obviously
associated with objects seen and touched, they have
a degree of materiality never assigned to such feelings as
Hunger and Thirst, Pleasure, Terror, and Hope.</p>

<p>43. When we refer feelings to material conditions, we
follow the natural tendency to translate the little known
in terms of the better known, and employ the symbols
Matter and Motion, because these furnish the intellect
with images, i. e. definite and exact elements to operate
with. In hearing a sound, there is nothing at all like
“vibrations,” nothing like “aerial waves” and “neural
processes,” given in that feeling; but on attempting to
<i>explain</i> it, we remove it from the sphere of Sensation to
carry it into the sphere of Intellect, and we must change
our symbols in changing our problem; here our only resource<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
is to translate the subjective state into an <i>imaginable</i>
objective process, which can only be expressed in
terms of Matter and Motion. What we <i>heard</i> as Sound
is then <i>seen</i> as Vibration. When we are optically or
mentally contemplating vibrations and neural processes,
we are supplanting one source of feeling by another,
translating an event in another set of symbols. But we
can no more hear the sound in seeing the vibrations,
than a blind man can see the fly in the amber which he
feels with his fingers, or than we can feel the amber he
holds, while we are only looking at it. The phrase “material
conditions of Feeling” sometimes designates the
objective aspect of the subjective process, and sometimes
the agencies in the external medium which co-operate
with the organism in the production of the feelings. In
each case there is an attempt to explain a feeling by intelligible
symbols.</p>

<p>44. The Animal probably never attempts such explanation;
satisfied with the facts, it is careless of their
factors. Man is never satisfied: is restless in the search
after factors; and having found them, seeks factors of
these factors; so that Lichtenberg felicitously calls him
“<i>das rastlose Ursachenthier</i>”—“the animal untiring in
the search for causes.” And thus sciences arise: we
translate experiences into geometrical, physical, chemical,
physiological, and psychological terms—different symbols
of the different modes of apprehending phenomena.</p>

<p>45. “I see an elephant.” In other words, I am affected
in a certain way, and interpret my affection by
previous similar experiences, expressing these in verbal
symbols. But I want an explanation, and this the philosopher
vouchsafes to me by translating my affection
into his terms. He takes me into another sphere—tells
me of an undulating Ether, the waves of which beat
upon my retina—of lines of Light refracted by media<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
and converged by lenses according to geometric laws—of
the formation thereby of a tiny image of the gigantic
elephant on my retina as on the plate of a camera-obscura—this,
and much more, is what <i>he</i> sees in <i>my</i> visual
feeling, and he bids me see it also. Grateful for the
novel instruction, I am compelled to say that it does
not alter my vision of the elephant, does not make the
fact a whit clearer, does not indeed correspond with what
I feel. It is outside knowledge, valuable, as all knowledge
is, but supplementary. It is translation into another
language. And when I come to examine the translation,
I find it very imperfect. I ask my instructor: Is it the
tiny image on my retina which I see, and not the big
elephant on the grass? And how do I see this retinal
image, which you explain to be upside down?—how is
it carried from my retina to my mind? I have no consciousness
of tiny reversed image, none of my retina,
only of a fact of feeling, which I call “seeing an elephant.”
The camera-obscura has no such feeling—it
reflects the image, it does not see the object. Here my
instructor, having reached the limit of his science,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> hands
me over to the physiologist, who will translate the fact
for me in terms not of Geometry, but of Anatomy and
Physiology. The laws of Dioptrics cease at this point:
the image they help to form on the retina is ruthlessly
dispersed, and all its beautiful geometric construction is
lost in a neural excitation, which is transmitted through
semifluid channels of an optic tract to a semifluid ganglion,
whence a thrill is shot through the whole brain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
and is there <i>transformed</i> into a visual sensation. Again
I fancy I have gained novel instruction of a valuable
kind; but it does not affect my original experience that
I am enabled to translate it into different terms; the
less so because I cannot help the conviction that the
translation is imperfect, leaving out the essential points.
If a phrase be translated for me into French or German,
I gain thereby an addition to my linguistic knowledge,
but the experience thus variously expressed remains unaffected.
When the fact is expressed in geometrical or
physiological terms, the <i>psychical process</i> finds no adequate
expression. Neither in the details, nor in the
totals, do I recognize any of the qualities of my state of
feeling in seeing the elephant. I do not see the geometrical
process, I do not see the anatomical mechanism, I
see the elephant, and am conscious only of that feeling.
You may consider my organism geometrically or anatomically,
and bring it thus within the circle of objective
knowledge; but my subjective experience, my spiritual
existence, that of which I am most deeply assured, demands
another expression. Nay more, on closely scrutinizing
your objective explanations, it is evident that a
psychical process is <i>implied</i> throughout—such terms as
undulations, refractions, media, lenses, retina, neural excitation,
overtly refer, indeed, to the material objective
aspect of the facts, but they are themselves the modes
of Feeling by which the facts are apprehended, and would
not exist <i>as such</i> without the “greeting of the spirit.”</p>

<p>46. What, then, is our conclusion? It is, that to
make an adequate explanation of psychical processes by
material conditions we must first establish an equivalence
between the subjective and objective aspects; and,
having taken this step, we must complete it by showing
wherein the difference exists; having established this
entity and diversity, we have solved the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
Let us attempt this solution. When I speak to you,
the spoken words are the same to you and to me. You
hear what I hear, you apprehend what I apprehend. But
there were muscular movements of articulation felt by
me and not felt by you; to feel these you also must
articulate the words; but so long as you merely hear
the words, there is a difference in our states of feeling.
Some of my movements you can see, others you can imagine;
but this is not my feeling of them, it is your
optical equivalent of my muscular feeling. On a similar
assumption of equivalence, a neural process is made to
stand for a logical process. In thinking a proposition,
we are logically grouping verbal symbols representative
of sensible experiences; and this is a quite peculiar state
of Consciousness, wholly unlike what would arise in the
mental or visual contemplation of the neural grouping,
which is its physiological equivalent. But this diversity
does not discredit the idea of their identity; and although
some of my readers will protest against such an
idea, and will affirm that the logical process is not a
process taking place in the organism at all, but in a spirit
which uses the organism as its instrument, I must be
allowed in this exposition to consider the identity established,
my purpose being to explain the diversity necessarily
accompanying it. Therefore, I say, that although
a logical process is identical with a neural process, it
must appear differently when the modes of apprehending
it are different. While you are thinking a logical proposition,
grouping your verbal symbols, I, who mentally
<i>see</i> the process, am grouping a totally different set of
symbols: to you the proposition is a subjective state, i. e.
a <i>state</i> of feeling, not an <i>object</i> of feeling: to become an
object, it must be apprehended by objective modes: and
this it can become to you as to me, when we see it as a
process, or imagine it as a process. But obviously your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
state in seeing or imagining the process must be different
from your state when the process itself is passing, since
the modes of apprehension are so different. There may
be every ground for concluding that a logical process has
its correlative physical process, and that the two processes
are merely two aspects of one event; but because we
cannot apprehend the one aspect as we apprehend the
other, cannot <i>see</i> the logical sequence as we <i>see</i> the physical
sequence, this difference in our modes of apprehension
compels us to separate the two, assigning one to the subjective,
the other to the objective class. Between the
sensible perception of an object and the reproduced image
of the object there is chiefly a quantitative difference in
the physiological and psychological processes: the image
is a faint sensation. Yet this quantitative difference
brings with it the qualitative distinction which is indicated
in our calling the one a sensation, the other a
thought. The consequence has been that while all philosophers
have admitted the sensation to be—at least
partly—a process in the bodily organism, the majority
have maintained that the thought is no such process in
the organism, but has its seat in a spirit independent of
the organism.</p>

<p>47. The states of Feeling which are associated with
other states characterized as objective because overtly
referring to a Not-Self, we group under the head of Matter:
we assign material conditions as their antecedents.
Whereas states of Feeling which are not thus associated
we group under the head of Mind, and assign internal
conditions as their antecedents. Color and Taste are
very different states of Feeling, yet both are spontaneously
referred to external causes, because they are associated
with visual and tactical states; whereas Hunger,
Nausea, Hope, etc., have no such associations, and their
material conditions are only theoretically assigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
Our intelligible universe is constructed out of the elements
of Feeling according to certain classifications, the
broadest of which is that into external and internal, object
and subject. The abstractions Matter and Mind
once formed and fixed in representative symbols, are
easily accredited as two different Reels. But the separation
is ideal, and is really a distinction of Aspects.
We know ourselves as Body-Mind; we do not know ourselves
as Body <i>and</i> Mind, if by that be meant two coexistent
independent Existents; and the illusion by which
the two Aspects appear as two Reals may be made intelligible
by the analysis of any ordinary proposition. For
example, when we say “this fruit is sweet,” we express
facts of Feeling—actual or anticipated—in abstract
terms. The concrete facts are these: a colored feeling,
a solid feeling, a sweet feeling, etc., have been associated
together, and the colored, solid, sweet group is symbolized
in the abstract term “fruit” But the color, solidity, and
sweetness are also abstract terms, representing feelings
associated in other groups, so that we find “fruit” which
has no “sweetness”; and “sweetness” in other things
besides “fruits.” Having thus separated ideally the
“sweetness” from the “fruit”—which in the concrete
sweet-fruit is not permissible—we easily come to imagine
a real distinction. This is the case with the concrete living
organism when we cease to consider it in its concrete
reality, and fix our attention on its abstract terms—Body
and Mind. We then think of Body apart from
Mind, and believe in them as two Reals, though neither
exists apart.</p>

<p>There is no state of consciousness in which object and
subject are not indissolubly combined. There is no physical
process which is not indissolubly bound up with
the psychical modes of apprehending it. Every idea is
either an image or a symbol—it has therefore objective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
reference, a material aspect. Every object is a synthesis
of feelings—it has therefore subjective reference, a material
aspect. Thus while all the evidence points to the
identity of Object and Subject, there is ample evidence
for the logical necessity of their ideal separation as Aspects.
This I have explained as a case of the general
principle which determines all distinctions—namely, the
diversity in the modes of production of the products,
which—subjectively—is diversity in the modes of apprehending
them. The optico-tactical experiences are
markedly different from the other experiences, as being
more directly referred to the Not-Self which resists; and
because these lend themselves to ideal constructions by
means of images and symbols, it is these experiences into
which we translate all the others when we come to explain
them and assign their conditions. For—and this
is the central position of our argument—all interpretation
consists in translating one set of feelings in the
terms of another set. We condense sets of feelings in
abstract symbols; to <i>understand</i> these we must reduce
them to their concrete significates. They are signs; we
must show what they are signs of.</p>

<p>Now the symbols Object and Subject are the most abstract
we can employ. Because they are universal, they
represent what cannot in reality be divorced. We can,
indeed, ideally separate ourselves from the Cosmos; in
the same way we can ideally separate our inner Self or
Soul from our outer Self or Body; and again our Soul
from its sentient states, our Body from its physical
changes. But not so in reality. The separation is a
logical artifice, and a logical necessity for Science.</p>

<p>The necessity will be obvious to any one who reflects
how the ideal constructions of Science demand precision
and integrity of terms. The problem of Automatism
brings this very clearly into view. The question is, Can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
we translate all psychological phenomena in mechanical
terms? If we <i>can</i>, we ought; because these terms have
the immense advantage of being <i>exact</i>, dealing as they do
with quantitative relations. But my belief is that we
cannot—nay, that we cannot even translate them all
into physiological terms. The distinction between quantitative
and qualitative knowledge (p. 354) is a barrier
against the mechanical interpretation. Physiology is a
classificatory science, not a science of measurement. Nor
can the laws of Mind be deduced from physiological processes,
unless supplemented by and interpreted by psychical
conditions individual and social.</p>

<p>48. <span class="firstword">Science</span> demands precision of terms; and in this
sense Condillac was justified in defining it, “<i>une langue
bien faite</i>.” The sciences of Measurement are exact because
of the precision of their terms, and are powerful
because of their exactness. The sciences of Classification
cannot aspire to this precision, and therefore, although
capable of attaining to a fuller knowledge of phenomena
than can be reached by their rivals, this advantage of a
wider range is accompanied by the disadvantage of a less
perfect exposition of results. While physicists and chemists
have only to settle the significance of the facts
observed, biologists and social theorists have over and
above this to settle the significance of the terms they
employ in expressing the facts observed. Hence more
than half their disputes are at bottom verbal.</p>

<p>This is markedly the case in the question of Automatism.
One man declares that animals are automata;
another that they are conscious automata; and while it is
quite possible to hold these views and not practically be
in disagreement with the views of ordinary men, or indeed
with the views of spiritualist and materialist philosophers,
we can never be sure that the advocates of Automatism
do not mean what they are generally understood to
mean. If a man says that by an automaton he does not
here mean a machine, such as a steam-engine or a watch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
but a vital mechanism which has its parts so adjusted
that its actions resemble those of a machine; and if he
adds that this automaton is also conscious of some of its
actions, though unconscious of others, we can only object
to his using terms which have misleading connotations.
If he mean by “conscious automata,” that animals are
mechanisms moved on “purely mechanical principles,”
their consciousness having nothing whatever to do with
the production of their actions, then indeed our objection
is not only to his use of terms, but to his interpretation
of the facts.</p>

<p>49. The questions of fact are two: Are animal mechanisms
rightfully classed beside machines? and, Is consciousness
a coefficient in the actions of animal mechanism?
The first has already been answered; the second demands
a preliminary settlement of the terms “conscious,” “unconscious,”
“voluntary,” and “involuntary.” The aim of
Physiology is to ascertain the particular combinations
of the elementary parts involved in each particular function—in
a word, the mechanism of organic phenomena;
and the modern Reflex Theory is an attempt to explain
this mechanism on purely mechanical principles, without
the co-operation of other principles, especially those of
Sensation and Volition. It is greatly aided by the ambiguity
of current terms. We are accustomed to speak
of certain actions as being performed unconsciously or
involuntarily. We are also accustomed to say that Consciousness
is necessary to transform an impression into a
sensation, and that Volition is the equivalent of conscious
effort. When, therefore, unconscious and involuntary
actions are recorded, they seem to be actions of an insentient
mechanism. The Reflex Theory once admitted,
a rigorous logic could not fail to extend it to all animal
actions.</p>

<p>50. I reject the Reflex Theory, on grounds hereafter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
be urged, but at present call attention to the great ambiguity
in the terms “conscious” and “unconscious.” In
one sense no definition of Consciousness can be satisfactory,
since it designates an ultimate fact, which cannot
therefore be made more intelligible than it is already.
In another sense no definition is needed, since every one
knows what is meant by saying, “I am conscious of such
a change, or such a movement.” It is here the equivalent
of Feeling. To be conscious of a change, is to feel a
change. If we desire to express it in physiological terms,
we must define Consciousness—“a function of the organism”;
and this definition we shall find eminently useful,
because the organism being a vital mechanism, and the
integrity of that mechanism being necessary for the integrity
of the function, while every variation of the mechanism
will bring a corresponding variation of the function,
we shall have an objective guide and standard in our
inquiries. Organisms greatly differ in complexity, yet
because they also agree in the cardinal conditions of
Vitality, among which Sensibility is one, we conclude
that they all have Feeling; but the Feeling of the one
will differ from that of another, according to the complexity
of the sentient mechanism in each. The perfection
of this mechanism lies in the co-ordination of its
parts, and the consensus of its sentient activities; any disturbance
of that consensus must cause a modification in the
total consciousness; and when the disturbance is profound
the modification is marked by such terms as “insanity,”
“loss of consciousness,” “insensibility.” These terms do
not imply that the sentient organs have lost their Sensibility,
but only that the disturbed mechanism has no
longer its normal consensus, no longer its normal state of
Consciousness. Each organ is active in its own way so
long as its own mechanism is preserved; but the united
action of the organs having been disturbed, their <i>resultant</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
function has been altered. Hence in a fit of Epilepsy
there is a complete absence of some normal reactions,
with exaggeration of others. In a state of Coma there
is no spontaneity—none of the manifold adaptations of
the organism to fluctuating excitations, external and internal,
observable in the normal state. The organism
still manifests Sensibility—but this is so unlike the
manifestations when its mechanism is undisturbed (and
necessarily so since the Sensibility varies with the mechanism)
that it is no longer called by the same name. In
the normal organism Sensibility means Feeling, or Consciousness;
but in the abnormal organism there is said to
be a “loss of Consciousness.” What the physiologist or
the physician means by the phrase “loss of Consciousness”
is intelligible, and for his purposes unobjectionable.
He observes many organic processes going on undisturbed—the
unconscious patient breathes, secretes, moves his
limbs, etc. These processes are referred to the parts of
the mechanism which are not disturbed; they are obviously
independent of that adjustment of the mechanism
which by its <i>consensus</i> has the special resultant named Consciousness;
he therefore concludes that these, and many
other organic processes, which are neither accompanied
nor followed by <i>discriminated</i> feelings, are the direct consequences
of the stimulated mechanism. He never hesitates
to adopt the popular language, and say, “We sometimes
act unconsciously, perceive unconsciously, and even think
unconsciously, all by the simple reflex of the mechanism.”</p>

<p>Now observe the opening for error in this language.
The actions are said to go on unconsciously, and, because
unconsciously, as pure reflexes, which are then assigned
to an insentient mechanism, and likened to the actions
of machines. But, as I hope hereafter to make evident,
the reflex mechanism necessarily involves Sensibility;
and therefore reflex actions may be unaccompanied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
Consciousness—in one meaning of that term—without
ceasing to be sentient, the feelings are operative, although
not discriminated. On the other hand, there is another
and very general meaning of the term Consciousness,
which is the equivalent of Sentience.</p>

<p>51. In discussing Automatism, or the Reflex Theory, it
is absolutely necessary that we should first settle the
meaning we assign to the term Consciousness. The laxity
with which the term is used may be seen in the enumeration
occupying six pages of Professor Bain’s account
of the various meanings. Psychology is often said to be
“the science of the facts of Consciousness”; and the
Brain is often assigned as “the organ of Consciousness.”
Yet there are many mental processes, and many cerebral
processes, which are declared to be unconscious. Obviously
if Consciousness is the function of the Brain, there
can be no cerebral activity which is unconscious; just as
there can be no activity of the lungs which is not respiratory.
Usage therefore points to a general and a special
sense of the term. The general usage identifies it with
Sensibility, in its subjective aspect as Sentience, including
all psychical states, both those classed under Sensation,
and those under Thought. These states are the “facts of
consciousness” with which Psychology is occupied. In
the special usage it is distinguished from all other psychical
states by a peculiar reflected feeling of Attention,
whereby we not only <i>have</i> a sensation, but also <i>feel</i> that
we have it; we not only think, but are conscious that we
are thinking; not only act, but are conscious of what we
do. It is this which Kant indicates when he defines it
“the subjective form accompanying all our conceptions
(<i>Begriffe</i>)”; and Jessen when he defines it “the internal
knowing of our knowing, an in itself reflected knowing.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
52. We shall often have to recur to this general and
this special meaning, both of which are too firmly rooted
for any successful attempt to displace them. The fact
that some organic processes and some mental processes
take place now consciously and now unconsciously, i. e.
now with the feeling of reflected attention, and now with
no such feeling, assuredly demands a corresponding expression;
nor, in spite of inevitable ambiguities, is there
ground for regretting that the expression chosen should
be only an extension of the expression already adopted
for all other states of Sentience. A sentient or conscious
state can only be a state of the sentient organism, itself
the unity of many organs, each having its Sensibility.
There is more or less consensus, but there is no introduction
of a new agent within the organism, converting what
was physical impression into mental reaction. From first
to last there has been nothing but neural processes, and
combinations of such processes—which, viewed subjectively,
are sentient processes. Thus the gradations of
sensitive reaction are Sentience, Consentience, and Consciousness,
which are represented in the Logic of Feeling
and the Logic of Signs. The familiar term Conscience
will then represent the Logic of Conduct. Thus understood,
we may say that a man sometimes acts unconsciously,
or thinks unconsciously, although his action and
thought are ruled by Consentience, as he sometimes acts
and thinks unconscientiously, although he is not without
obedience to Conscience on other occasions. The feeling
which determines an action is <i>operative</i>, although it may
not be <i>discriminated</i> from simultaneous feelings. When
this is the case, we say the feeling is unconscious; but
this no more means that it is a purely physical process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
taking place outside the sphere of Sentience, than the
immoral conduct of a man would be said to be mechanical,
and not the conduct of a moral agent. There is
undoubtedly a marked distinction expressed in the terms
Consciousness and Unconsciousness, but it is not that of
contrasts such as Mental and Physical, it is that of grades
such as Light and Darkness. Just as Darkness is a positive
optical sensation very different from mere privation—just
as it replaces the sensation of Light, blends with it,
struggles with it, and in all respects differs from the <i>absence</i>
of all optical sensibility in the skin; so Unconsciousness
struggles with, blends with, and replaces Consciousness in
the organism, and is a positive state of the sentient organism,
not to be confounded with a mere negation of Sentience;
above all, not to be relegated to merely mechanical
processes.</p>

<p>52 <i>a</i>. Remember that, strictly speaking, Consciousness
is a psychological not a physiological term, and is only
used in Physiology on the assumption that it is the subjective
<i>equivalent</i> of an objective process. To avoid the
equivoque of “unconscious sensation,” we may substitute
the term “unconscious neural process”; and as all neural
processes imply Sensibility, which in the subjective aspect
is Sentience, we say that Sentience has various modes and
degrees—such as Perception, Ideation, Emotion, Volition,
which may be conscious, sub-conscious, or unconscious.
When Leibnitz referred to the fact of “obscure ideas,”
and modern writers expressed this fact as “unconscious
cerebration,” the first phrase did not imply a process that
was other than mental, the second phrase did not imply a
process that was other than physiological: both indicated
a mode of the process known as Consciousness under other
modes. There are different neural elements grouped in
Ideation and Emotion; there are different neural elements
grouped in Consciousness, Sub-consciousness, and Unconsciousness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
but one tissue with one property is active
in all.</p>

<p>53. The nervous organism is affected as a whole by every
affection of its constituent parts. Every excitation, instead
of terminating with itself—as is the case in most
physical processes—or with the motor impulse it excites,
is propagated throughout the continuous tissue, and thus
sends a <i>thrill</i> throughout the organism. The wave of
excitation in passing onwards beats against variously
grouped elements—temporary and permanent centres—disturbing
their balance more or less, and liberating the
energy of some, increasing the tension of others, necessarily
affecting all. Those groups which have their energy
liberated set up processes that are either <i>discriminated</i> as
sensations, or are blended with the general stream, according
to their <i>relative</i> energy in the consensus. Thus the
impulse on reaching the centres for the heart, lungs, legs,
and tail excites the innervation of these organs; but as
these are only parts of the organism, and as all the parts
enter the consensus, and Consciousness is the varying
resultant of this ever-varying consensus, the thrill which
any particular stimulus excites will be unconscious, sub-conscious,
or conscious, in proportion to the extent of the
<i>irradiated</i> disturbance, which will depend on the statical
conditions of the centres at the moment. A sound sends
a thrill which excites emotion, causes the heart to beat
faster, the muscles to quiver, the skin-glands to pour forth
their secretion; yet this same sound heard by another
man, or the same man under other conditions, physical or
historical, merely sends a faint thrill, just vivid enough
to detach itself as a sensation from the other simultaneous
excitations; and the same sound may excite
a thrill which is so faint and fugitive as to pass unconsciously.
Physiological and psychological inductions
assure us that these are only differences of degree. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
same kind of physiological effect accompanies the conscious
and unconscious state. Every sensory impression,
no matter whether discriminated or not, affects
the circulation and develops heat. The blood-vessels of
the part impressed expand, vessels elsewhere contract—a
change in the blood pressure has been effected, which
of course implies that the whole organism has been
affected. Delicate instruments show that at the time
a sensation is produced the temperature of the brain is
raised. The same is true of ideation. Mosso has invented
a method of registering the effect of thought on the circulation.
He finds ideation accompanied by a contraction
of the peripheral vessels proportionate to the degree
of intellectual effort. A young man translating Greek
showed greater contraction than when he was translating
Latin. During sound sleep—when we are said to be
unconscious—sudden noises always cause contraction
of the peripheral vessels. Psychological observation assures
us that the conscious and unconscious states were
both consentient, and were both operative in the same
degree. The absorbed thinker threads his way through
crowded streets, and is sub-conscious and unconscious of
the various sights, sounds, touches, and muscular movements
which make up so large a portion of his sentient
excitation at the time; yet he deftly avoids obstacles, hears
the sound of a hurried step behind him, recognizes an interesting
object directly it presents itself, and can even
recall in Memory many of the uninteresting objects which
he passed in sub-conscious and unconscious indifference.</p>

<p>54. On all grounds, therefore, we must say that between
conscious, sub-conscious, and unconscious states the
difference is only of degree of complication in the neural
processes, which by relative preponderance in the consensus
determine a relative discrimination. We can only
discriminate one thrill at a time; but the neural excitations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
simultaneously pressing towards a discharge are
many; and the conditions which determine now this, and
now the other excitation to predominate by its differential
pressure, are far beyond any mechanical estimate. I
mention this because the advocates of the Reflex Theory
maintain that the neural processes are the same whether
a sensation be produced or not; and that since the same
actions follow the external stimulation whether sensation
be produced or not, this proves the actions to be purely
mechanical. I reply, the neural processes are <i>not</i> the
same throughout in the two cases—otherwise the effects
would be the same. You might as well say, “Since the
explosion of the gun is the same, whether shotted or not,
a blank cartridge will kill”; but if you tell me that your
gun killed the bird, I declare that the cartridge was <i>not</i> a
blank one. Whether the explosion of the gun <i>also</i> produced
terror in one bystander, curiosity in a second, and
attracted no notice from a third, will be altogether another
matter. In like manner the sensory impression which
determines a movement may or may not be accompanied
or followed by <i>other</i> sentient states; the fact of such
movement is evidence of its sentient antecedent; and an
external stimulus that will produce <i>this</i> neural process,
and this consequent movement, must produce a feeling,
although not necessarily a discriminated sensation. Now
since, for discrimination, <i>other</i> neural processes must co-operate,
we cannot say that in the two cases <i>all</i> the neural
processes have been the same throughout; nor because of
this difference can we say that the process of the undiscriminated
sensation is a mechanical, not a sentient process.
In the next problem this point will be argued more fully.</p>

<p>55. The need of recognizing Consciousness and Consentience
as degrees of energy and complexity in sentient
states is apparent when we consider animal phenomena.
Has a bee consciousness? Has a snail volition?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
or are they both insentient mechanisms? All inductions
warrant the assertion that a bee has thrills propagated
throughout its organism by the agency of its nerves; and
that some of these thrills are of the kind called sensations—even
discriminated sensations. Nevertheless we
may reasonably doubt whether the bee has sentient states
resembling otherwise than remotely the sensations, emotions,
and thoughts which constitute human Consciousness,
either in the general or the special sense of that
term. The bee feels and reacts on feelings; but its feelings
cannot closely resemble our own, because the conditions
in the two cases are different. The bee may even
be said to think (in so far as Thought means logical combination
of feelings), for it appears to form Judgments
in the sphere of the Logic of Feeling—το νοητικὸν;
although incapable of the Logic of Signs—το διανοητικον.
We should therefore say the bee has Consentience, but
not Consciousness—unless we accept Consciousness in
its <i>general</i> signification as the equivalent of Sentience.
The organism of the bee differs from that of a man, as a
mud hut from a marble palace. But since underlying
these differences there are fundamental resemblances, the
functions of the two will be fundamentally alike. Both
have the function of Sentience; as mud hut and palace
have both the office of sheltering.</p>

<p>56. The question of Volition will occupy us in the
next chapter. Restricting ourselves here to that of
Consciousness, and recalling the distinction of the two
meanings of the term, we now approach the question of
Unconsciousness. Are we to understand this term as
designating a purely physical state in contrast to the
purely mental state of Consciousness; or only as designating
a difference of degree? This is like asking
whether Light and Darkness are both optical feelings, or
one an optical feeling and the other a physical process?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
On the Reflex Theory, no sooner does a vital and mental
process pass from the daylight of Consciousness, or twilight
of Sub-consciousness, into the darkness of Unconsciousness,
than the whole order of phenomena is abruptly
changed, they cease to be vital, mental, and lapse into
physical, mechanical processes. The grounds of this conclusion
are, first, the unpsychological assumption that the
unconscious state is out of the sphere of Sentience; and
secondly, the unphysiological assumption that the Brain
is the only portion of the nervous system which has the
property of Sensibility. Restate the conclusion in different
terms and its fallacy emerges: “organic processes
suddenly cease to be organic, and become purely physical
by a slight change in their <i>relative</i> position in the consensus;
the organic process which was a conscious sensation
a moment ago, when its energy was not balanced by
some other process, suddenly falls from its place in the
group of organic phenomena—sentient phenomena—to
sink into the group of inorganic phenomena now that its
energy is balanced.” Consider the parallel case of Motion
and Rest in the objective sphere. They are two functions
of the co-operant forces, one dynamic, the other static;
although markedly distinguishable as functions, we know
that they are simply the co-operant forces now unbalanced
and now balanced; what we call Rest is also a product
of moving forces, each of which is operant, and will issue
in a definite resultant when its counter-force is removed.
Motion and Rest are correlatives, and both belong to the
sphere of Kinetics. In like manner Consciousness and
Unconsciousness are correlatives, both belonging to the
sphere of Sentience.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> Every one of the unconscious processes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
is operant, changes the general state of the organism,
and is capable of at once issuing in a discriminated
sensation when the force which balances it is disturbed.
I was unconscious of the scratch of my pen in writing
the last sentence, but I am distinctly conscious of every
scratch in writing this one. Then, as now, the scratching
sound sent a faint thrill through my organism, but its
relative intensity was too faint for discrimination; now
that I have redistributed the co-operant forces, by what is
called an act of Attention, I hear distinctly every sound
the pen produces.</p>

<p>57. The inclusion of Sub-consciousness within the sentient
sphere is obvious; the inclusion of Unconsciousness
within that sphere may be made so, when we consider its
modes of production, and compare it with the extra-sensible
conception of molecules and atoms. The Matter
which is sensible as masses, may be resolved into molecules,
which lie beyond the discrimination of sense; and
these again into atoms, which are purely ideal conceptions;
but because molecules are <i>proved</i>, and atoms are
<i>supposed</i>, to have material properties, and to conform to
sensible canons of the objective world, we never hesitate
to class them under the head of Matter; nor do we imagine
that in passing beyond the discrimination of Sense
they lose their objective significance. They are still physical,
not mental facts. So with Sentience: we may trace
it through infinite gradations from Consciousness to Sub-consciousness,
till it fades away in Unconsciousness; but
from first to last the processes have been those of a sentient
organism; and by this are broadly distinguished
from all processes in anorganisms. The movement of a
limb has quite different modes of production from the
movement of a wheel; and among its modes must be
included those of Sensibility, a peculiarly vital property.
Oxidation may be slow or rapid, manifesting itself as combustion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
heat, or flame, but it is always oxidation—always
a special chemical phenomenon. And so the neural
process of Sentience, whether conscious, sub-conscious,
or unconscious, is always a state of the sentient organism.
If a material process does not change its character, and
become spiritual, on passing beyond the range of sensible
appreciation, why should a psychical process become material
on passing beyond the range of discrimination? If
we admit molecules as physical units, sentient tremors are
psychical units. The extra-sensible molecules have indeed
their subjective aspect, and only enter perception
through the “greeting of the spirit.” The sentient tremors
have also their objective aspect, and cannot come
into existence without the neural tremors, which are their
physical conditions.</p>

<p>58. It is only by holding fast to such a conception that
we can escape the many difficulties and contradictions
presented by unconscious phenomena, and explain many
physiological and psychological processes. Descartes—followed
by many philosophers—identified Consciousness
with Thought. To this day we constantly hear that to
have a sensation, and to be conscious of it, is one and the
same state; which is only admissible on the understanding
that Consciousness means Sentience, and Sentience
the activity of the nervous system viewed subjectively.
Leibnitz pointed out that we have many psychical states
which are unconscious states—to have an idea and be
conscious of it, are, he said, not one but two states.
The Consciousness by Descartes erected into an essential
condition of Thought, was by Leibnitz reduced to an accompaniment
which not only may be absent, but in the
vast majority of cases is absent. The teaching of most
modern psychologists is that Consciousness forms but a
small item in the total of psychical processes. Unconscious
sensations, ideas, and judgments are made to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
a great part in their explanations. It is very certain that
in every conscious volition—every act that is so characterized—the
larger part of it is quite unconscious. It is
equally certain that in every perception there are unconscious
processes of reproduction and inference—there is
much that is <i>implicit</i>, some of which cannot be made explicit—a
“middle distance” of sub-consciousness, and a
“background” of unconsciousness. But, throughout, the
processes are those of Sentience.</p>

<p>59. Unconsciousness is by some writers called <i>latent</i>
Consciousness. Experiences which are no longer manifested
are said to be stored up in Memory, remaining in
the Soul’s picture-gallery, visible directly the shutters are
opened. We are not conscious of these feelings, yet they
exist as latent feelings, and become salient through association.
As a metaphorical expression of the familiar
facts of Memory this may pass; but it has been converted
from a metaphor into an hypothesis, and we are supposed
to <i>have</i> feelings and ideas, when in fact we have nothing
more than a modified <i>disposition</i> of the organism—temporary
or permanent—which when stimulated will respond
in this modified manner. The modification of the
organism when permanent becomes hereditary; and its
response is then called an instinctive or automatic action.
And as actions pass by degrees from conscious and voluntary
into sub-conscious and sub-voluntary, and finally
into unconscious and involuntary, we call them volitional,
secondarily automatic, and automatic. If any one likes
to say the last are due to latent consciousness, I shall not
object. I only point to the fact that the differences here
specified are simply differences of degree—all the actions
are those of the sentient organism.</p>

<p>60. Picture to yourself this sentient organism incessantly
stimulated from without and from within, and
adjusting itself in response to such stimulations. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
blending of stimulations, modifying and arresting each
other, there is a fluctuating “composition of forces,” with
ever-varying resultants. Besides the stream of direct
stimulations, there is a wider stream of indirect or reproduced
stimulations. Together with the present sensation
there is always a more or less complex group of revived
sensations, the one group of neural tremors being organically
stimulated by the other. An isolated excitation is
impossible in a continuous nervous tissue; an isolated
feeling is impossible in the consensus or unity of the
sentient organism. The term Soul is the personification
of this complex of present and revived feelings, and is
the substratum of Consciousness (in the general sense),
all the particular feelings being its <i>states</i>. To repeat an
illustration used in my first volume, we may compare
Consciousness to a mass of stationary waves. If the surface
of a lake be set in motion each wave diffuses itself
over the whole surface, and finally reaches the shores,
whence it is reflected back towards the centre of the lake.
This reflected wave is met by the fresh incoming waves,
there is a blending of the waves, and their product is a
pattern on the surface. This pattern of stationary waves
is a fluctuating pattern, because of the incessant arrival
of fresh waves, incoming and reflected. Whenever a fresh
stream enters the lake (i. e. a new sensation is excited
from without), its waves will at first pass over the pattern,
neither disturbing it nor being disturbed by it; but
after reaching the shore the waves will be reflected back
towards the centre, and there will more or less modify
the pattern.</p>

<span class="subhead">VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ACTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>61. <span class="firstword">Much</span> of what has been said in the preceding
chapter respecting the passive side of the organism is
equally applicable to the active side. Our actions are
classed as voluntary and involuntary mainly in reference
to their being consciously or unconsciously performed;
but not wholly so, for there are many involuntary actions
of which we are distinctly conscious, and many voluntary
actions of which we are at times sub-conscious and unconscious.
I do not propose here to open the long and
arduous discussion as to what constitutes Volition, my
present purpose being simply that of fixing the meaning
of terms, so that the question of Automatism may not be
complicated by their ambiguities. “Voluntary” and “involuntary”
are, like “conscious” and “unconscious,” correlative
terms; but commonly, instead of being understood
as indicating differences of degree in phenomena
of the same order, they are supposed to indicate differences
of kind—a new agent, the Will, being understood
in the one case to direct the Mechanism which suffices
without direction in the other.</p>

<p>62. This interpretation is unphysiological and unpsychological,
since it overlooks the fact that both voluntary
and involuntary actions belong to the same <i>order</i> of phenomena,
i. e. those of the sentient organism. Both involve
the same <i>efficient</i> cause, i. e. co-operant conditions.
We draw a line of demarcation between the two abstractions—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
between all abstractions—but the concrete
processes they symbolize have no such demarcation.
Just as the thought which at one moment passes unconsciously,
at another consciously, is in itself the same
thought, and the same neural process; so the action which
at one moment is voluntary, and at another involuntary,
is itself the same action, performed by the same mechanism.
The incitation which precedes, and the feeling
which accompanies the action, belong to the accessory
mechanisms, and may be replaced by other incitations
and other feelings; as the fall of an apple is the same
event, involving the same conditions, i. e. efficient cause,
whether the <i>occasional</i> cause be a gust of wind or the
gardener’s scissors, and whether the fall be seen and
heard or not. I may utter words intentionally and consciously,
and I may utter the same words automatically,
unconsciously; I may wink voluntarily, and wink involuntarily.
There are terms to express these differences;
but they do not express a difference in the efficient
agencies.</p>

<p>63. Many writers seem to think that the involuntary
actions belong to the physical mechanical order, because
they are not stimulated by cerebral incitations, and cannot
be regulated or controlled by such incitations—or as
the psychologists would say, because Consciousness in
the form of Will is no agent prompting and regulating
such actions. But I think this untenable. The actions
cannot belong to the mechanical order so long as they are
the actions of a vital mechanism, and so long as we admit
the broad distinction between organisms and anorganisms.
Whether they have the special character of Consciousness
or not, they have the general character of sentient actions,
being those of a sentient mechanism. And this becomes
the more evident when we consider the gradations of the
phenomena. Many, if not all, of those actions which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
classed under the involuntary were originally of the voluntary
class—either in the individual or his ancestors;
but having become permanently organized dispositions—the
pathways of stimulation and reaction having been
definitely established—they have lost that volitional element
(of hesitation and choice) which implies regulation
and control. But even here a slight change in the habitual
conditions will introduce a disturbance in the process
which may awaken Consciousness, and the sense of effort,
sometimes even causing control. An instinctive or an
automatic action may be thus changed, or arrested. Take
as an example one of the unequivocally automatic actions,
that of Breathing. It is called automatic because, like
the actions of an automaton, it is performed by a definitely
constructed mechanism, always working in the
same way when stimulated and left to itself. There must
of course be a sense of effort in every impulse which has
resistance to overcome, organs to be moved; but the
mechanism of Breathing is so delicately adjusted, that
the sense of effort is reduced to a minimum, and we are
unconscious of it, or sub-conscious of it. Nevertheless,
without altering the rate or amplitude of the inspirations
and expirations, we become distinctly conscious of them,
and, moreover, within certain limits we can control them,
so that the Breathing passes from the involuntary to the
voluntary class.</p>

<p>64. Pass on to other examples. What action can be
more involuntary than the rhythmic movements of the
heart and the contractions of the iris? Compared with
the actions of the tongue or limbs, these seem riveted by
an iron necessity, freed from all consciousness and control.
Yet the movements of the heart are not only stimulated
by sensations and thoughts, they are also capable
of being felt; and the movements both of heart and iris
are not wholly removed from our control. That we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
not habitually control (that is, <i>interfere</i> with) the action
of the heart, the contraction of the iris, or the activity of
a gland, is true; it is on this account that such actions
are called involuntary; they obey the immediate stimulus.
But it is an error to assert that these actions <i>cannot</i>
be controlled, that they are altogether beyond the interference
of other centres, and cannot by any effort of ours
be modified. It is an error to suppose these actions are
essentially distinguished from the voluntary movement
of the hands. We have acquired a power of definite
direction in the movements of the hands, which renders
them obedient to our will; but this acquisition has been
of slow laborious growth. If we were asked to use our
toes as we use our fingers—to grasp, paint, sew, or write
with them, we should find it not less impossible to control
the movements of the toes in these directions, than
to contract the iris, or cause a burst of perspiration to
break forth. Certain movements of the toes are possible
to us; but unless the loss of our fingers has made it
necessary that we should use our toes in complicated
and slowly acquired movements, we can do no more with
them than the young infant can do with his fingers. Yet
men and women have written, sewed, and painted with
their toes. All that is requisite is that certain links
should be established between sensations and movements;
by continual practice these links <i>are</i> established; and
what is impossible to the majority of men, becomes easy
to the individual who has acquired this power. This
same power can be acquired over what are called the
organic actions; nevertheless the habitual needs of life
do not <i>tend</i> towards such acquisition, and without some
strong current setting in that direction, or some peculiarity
of organization rendering it easy, it is never acquired.
In ordinary circumstances the number of those
who can write with their toes is extremely rare, the urgent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
necessity which would create such a power being
rare; and rare also are the examples of those who have
any control over the movement of the iris, or the action
of a gland; but both rarities exist.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to choose a more striking example
of reflex action than the contraction of the iris of the eye
under the stimulus of light;<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and to ordinary men, having
no link established which would guide them, it is
utterly impossible to close the iris by any effort. It
would be not less impossible to the hungry child to get
on the chair and reach the food on the table, until that
child had <i>learned</i> how to do so. Yet there are men who
have learned how to contract the iris. The celebrated
Fontana had this power; which is possessed also by a
medical man now living at Kilmarnock—Dr. Paxton—a
fact authenticated by no less a person than Dr. Allen
Thomson.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> Dr. Paxton can contract or expand the iris
at will, without changing the position of his eye, and
without an effort of adaptation to distance.</p>

<p>To move the ears is impossible to most men. Yet
some do it with ease, and all could learn to do it. Some
men have learned to “ruminate” their food; others to
vomit with ease; and some are said to have the power of
perspiring at will.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Now, if once we recognize a link of
sensation and motion, we recognize a possible source
of control; and if the daily needs of life were such that
to fulfil some purpose the action of the heart required
control, we should learn to control it. Some men have,
without such needs, learned how to control it. The
eminent physiologist, E. F. Weber of Leipzig, found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
he could completely check the beating of his heart. By
suspending his breath and violently contracting his chest,
he could retard the pulsations; and after three or five
beats, unaccompanied by any of the usual sounds, it was
completely still. On one occasion he carried the experiment
too far, and fell into a syncope. Cheyne, in the
last century, recorded the case of a patient of his own
who could at will suspend the beating of his pulse, and
always fainted when he did so.</p>

<p>65. It thus appears that even the actions which most
distinctly bear the character recognized as involuntary—uncontrollable—are
only so because the ordinary
processes of life furnish no necessity for their control.
We do not learn to control them, though we could do
so, to some extent; nor do we learn to control the motions
of our ears, although we could do so. And while
it appears that the involuntary actions can become voluntary,
it is familiar to all that the voluntary actions
tend, by constant repetition, to become involuntary.
Thus involuntary actions, under certain limitations, may
be controlled; on the other hand, the voluntary are incapable
of being controlled under the urgency of direct
stimulation. Both are reflexes.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as almost all actions are the products of
stimulated nerve-centres, it is obvious that these actions
are reflex—reflected from those centres. It matters not
whether I wink because a sensation of dryness, or because
an idea of danger, causes the eyelid to close: the
act is equally reflex. The nerve-centre which supplies
the eyelid with its nerve has been stimulated; the stimuli
may be various, the act is uniform. At one time the
stimulus is a sensation of dryness, at another an idea
of danger, at another the idea of communicating by
means of a wink with some one present; in each case
the stimulus is reflected in a muscular contraction. Sensations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
excite other sensations; ideas excite other ideas;
and one of these ideas may issue in an action of control.
But the restraining power is limited, and cannot resist a
certain degree of urgency in the original stimulus. I
can, for a time, restrain the act of winking, in spite of the
sensation of dryness; but the reflex which sets going this
restraining action will only last a few seconds; after
which, the urgency of the external stimulus is stronger
than that of the reflex feeling—the sensation of dryness
is more imperious than the idea of resistance—and the
eyelid drops.</p>

<p>If a knife be brought near the arm of a man who has
little confidence in the friendly intentions of him that
holds it, he shrinks, and the shrinking is “involuntary,”
i. e. in spite of his will. Let him have confidence, and
he does not shrink, even when the knife touches his skin.
The idea of danger is not excited in the second case, or
if excited, is at once banished by another idea. Yet this
very man, who can thus repress the involuntary shrinking
when the knife approaches his arm, cannot repress
the involuntary winking when the same friend approaches
a finger to his eye. In vain he prepares himself to resist
that reflex action; in vain he resolves to resist the impulse;
no sooner does the finger approach, than down
flashes the eyelid. Many men, and most women, would
be equally unable to resist shrinking on the approach of
a knife: the association of the idea of danger with the
knife would bear down any previous resolution not to
shrink. It is from this cause that timorous women tremble
at the approach of firearms. An association is established
in their minds which no idea is powerful enough
to loosen. You may assure them the gun is not loaded;
“<i>that</i> makes very little difference,” said a naïve old lady
to a friend of mine. They tremble, as the child trembles
when he sees you put on the mask. These illustrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
show that the urgency of any one idea may, like the urgency
of a sensation, bear down the resistance offered by
some other idea; as the previous illustrations showed
that an idea could restrain or control the action which a
sensation or idea would otherwise have produced. According
to the doctrines current, the Will is said to be
operative when an idea determines an action; and yet all
would agree that the winking which was involuntary
when the idea of danger determined it, was voluntary
when the idea of communicating with an accomplice in
some mystification determined it.</p>

<p>66. There is no real and essential distinction between
voluntary and involuntary actions. They all spring from
Sensibility. They are all determined by feeling. It is
convenient, for common purposes, to designate some actions
as voluntary; but this is merely a convenience; no
psychological nor physiological insight is gained by it; an
analysis of the process discloses no element in a voluntary
action which is not to be found in an involuntary
action—except in the origin or degree of stimulation.
In ordinary language it is convenient to mark a distinction
between my raising my arm because I will to raise it
for some definite purpose, and my raising it because a bee
has stung me; it is convenient to say, “I <i>will</i> to write
this letter,” and “this letter is written against my will—I
have no will in the matter.” But Science is more exacting
when it aims at being exact; and the philosopher,
analyzing these complex actions, will find that in each
case certain muscular groups have been set in action by
different sensational or ideational stimuli. The action
itself is that of a neuro-muscular mechanism, which
mechanism works in the same way, whatever be the source
of the original impulse. The stimulation may be incited
directly from the periphery, or indirectly from a remote
centre; and the action may be arrested by a peripheral or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
central stimulation: the reflex which ordinarily follows
the excitation of a sensory nerve will be modified, or
arrested, if some other nerve be at the same time stimulated.
(See Law of Arrest, <i>Prob.</i> II. § <a href="#II_190">190</a>.)</p>

<p>67. All actions are reflex, all are the operations of a
mechanism, all are sentient, because the mechanism has
Sensibility as its vital property. In thus preserving the
integrity of the order of vital phenomena, and keeping
them classified apart from physical and chemical phenomena,
we by no means set aside the useful distinctions expressed
in the terms voluntary and involuntary; any more
than we set aside the distinction of vertebrate and invertebrate
when both are classed under Animal, and separated
from Plant, or Planet.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of the special Senses respond in special
reactions; the mechanisms of special actions have
also their several responses. The tail responds to stimulation
with lateral movements, the chest with inspiration
and expiration, and so on. These responses are called
automatic, and have this in common with the actions of
automata that they are uniform, and do not need the
co-operation of Consciousness, though they do need the
operation of Sensibility, and are thereby distinguished from
the actions of automata. The facial muscles, and the
limbs, also respond to stimulation in uniform ways, but
owing to the varieties of stimulation the actions are more
variable, and have more the character of volitional movements.
With this greater freedom of possible action
comes the eminently mental character of <i>choice</i>. In the
cerebral rehearsal of an act not yet performed—its mental
prevision—as when we intend to do something, yet
for the moment arrest the act, so that there is only a nascent
excitation of the motor process, there is a peculiar
state of Consciousness expressive of this state of the
mechanism: we call the prevision a <i>motive</i>—and it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
a <i>motor</i> when the intention is realized, the nascent
excitation becomes an unchecked impulse. The abstract
of all motives we call Will. A motive is a volition in
the sphere of the Intellect. In the sphere of Emotion it
is a motor. Hence we never speak of the Will of a mollusc,
or the motives of an insect, only of their sensations
and motors. Yet it is obvious that the reflex in operation
when a snail shrinks at the approach of an object is essentially
similar to the reflex in operation when the baby
shrinks, and this again is still more similar to that in
operation when the boy shrinks: the boy has the idea of
danger, which neither baby nor snail can have; the idea
is a motive, which can be controlled by another idea;
the baby and the snail can have no such motive, no such
control—are they therefore automata?</p>

<p>68. If I see that a donkey has wandered into my garden,
the motive which determines me to take a stick and
with it drive the donkey away is a cerebral rehearsal of
the effects which will follow my act. The sight of the
donkey has roused disagreeable feelings, and these suggest
possible means of alleviation; out of these possibilities—reproductions
of former experiences—I choose one.
But if I seize the stick with which some one is threatening
me, I do not pause to choose, I snatch automatically
without hesitation. Yet this unreflecting automatic act
is itself as truly volitional as my seizing the stick to drive
away the donkey—it is the motor which has been organized
in me by previous experiences—it is the consequence
of an emotion, not of a deliberation; and it has
not been determined by any clear prevision of consequences.
Feeling inspires, and feeling guides my movements,
so that if my snatch has missed the stick, I snatch
again, or duck under. This is the kind of Volition we
ascribe to animals. It is a great part of our own. By
insensible degrees, acts which originally were prompted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
by motives sink into the automatic class prompted by
motors. When an angry man snatches up a knife, doffs
bystanders aside, and rushes on his enemy to stab him, he
does not distinctly prefigure the final result, he only obeys
each motor, and is conscious of each step; but had he
planned the murder he would have foreseen the end, and
this prevision would have been the motive. The angry
man is struck with horror at the sight of the bleeding
corpse, and passionately declares he did not <i>mean</i> to kill.
Nor did he will the consequences of his act, yet he certainly
willed each separate step—he recognized the knife,
saw the bystanders, knew they would interfere with him,
willed to push them aside. He may be right in declaring
that the act was involuntary; but assuredly it was not
purely mechanical.</p>

<p>69. Again, we are not conscious of the separate sensations
which guide speech or writing; we cannot properly
be said to will the utterance of each tone, or the formation
of each letter. Are these processes mechanical and
not volitional? By no means. We know that they were
laboriously learned by long tentative efforts, each of which
was accompanied by distinct consciousness. We also
know that now when the mechanism is so easy in its
adjustment as to suggest automatism, there needs but a
slight alteration in the conditions to make us distinctly
conscious of the processes—the wrong word spoken, or
one letter ill formed, suffices to arrest the easy working
of the mechanism. A similar mechanism operates in
thinking, which also lapses from the conscious and voluntary
to the unconscious and involuntary state. The logical
process of Judgment is as purely a reflex from one
neural group to another, as the physiological process of
co-ordination. In ordinary thinking we are as little conscious
of the particular steps—our interest being concentrated
on the result—as we are of the particular stages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
of an action. The adjustments of the mechanism of Reproduction
and Association are <i>set</i> going by a motive, and
<i>kept</i> going by psychological motors. And here—as in
bodily actions—there is often a conflict between motive
and motors—between the foreseen result, and the available
means of reaching it—the motors usually prevailing
because they represent the active side of the mechanism.
Thus when an oculist wishes to examine a patient’s eye,
he does not tell him to give a particular direction to his
eye, knowing that the <i>motive</i> to do so will not suffice;
instead of this he simply moves his own hand in the desired
direction, certain that the eye will by reflex irresistibly
follow it. Nay, there are sometimes such anomalies
of innervation that the eye, instead of obeying the motive,
moves in a contrary direction. Meschede mentions a
patient whose movements were mostly of this anomalous
kind: when he willed to move the eyes to the right, they
moved to the left; when he willed to move them up, they
moved down. It was thus also with his hands and feet.
Yet he was distinctly conscious that his intention had
been frustrated, and that he acted “because he could not
help it.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> How insensibly a motive sinks into a motor,
that is to say, a voluntary into an involuntary act, may be
recognized in speech, writing, singing, walking, etc., and
in the incessant movements of the eye in fixing objects.
Aubert has well remarked that we only give definite
movements to the eye when we wish to see an object
distinctly. Whenever the indistinct vision suffices—as
in walking through the streets occupied in conversation
or thought—we make no such movements; but
no sooner does any object excite our attention, than
the effort to fix that object at once excites the necessary
reflex.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
70. By the Will, then, we must understand the abstract
generalized expression of the impulses which determine
actions, when those impulses have an ideal origin; by
Volition the still more generalized expression of all impulses
which determine actions. The one class is that
of <i>motives</i> with ideal elements; the other that of <i>motors</i>
with sensational or emotional elements. But both are
mental states, both are neural processes in a sentient
organism; neither is mechanical, except in so far as all
actions are expressible in mechanical terms. For convenience
we class actions as reflex, automatic, involuntary,
unconscious, voluntary, and conscious. If we separate the
reflex from the voluntary, we need not therefore dissociate
the former from Sensibility; and the reason why we ought
not to separate it is that we know it to be sense-guided
from first to last, although the sensations may escape discrimination.
The feeling of Effort, which was formerly
felt when an action was performed, may have become so
minimized that it is too faint for more than a momentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
consciousness, too evanescent for the memory to retain it;
yet the feeling must always be operant when its mechanism
is in action. The ease with which the mechanism
works does not change the adjustment of its elements,
nor alter its character. The facile unobtrusive performance
of a vital function does not change it from a vital to
a mechanical act. Mr. Spencer seems to me to express
himself ambiguously when he says: “Just as any set of
psychical changes originally displaying Memory, Reason,
and Feeling cease to be conscious, rational, and emotional
as fast as they by repetition grow closely organized, so do
they at the same time pass beyond the sphere of Volition.
Memory, Reason, Feeling, and Will disappear in proportion
as psychical changes become automatic”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>—for while
it is perfectly true that we only call those psychical
changes “automatic” which have lost the special qualities
called “conscious, rational, and emotional,” it is not less
true that they remain from first to last <i>psychical</i> changes,
and are thereby distinguished from <i>physical</i> changes. To
suppose that they pass from the psychical to the physical
by frequent repetition would lead to the monstrous conclusion
that when a naturalist has by laborious study
become so familiarized with the specific marks of an
animal or plant that he can recognize at a glance a particular
species, or recognize from a single character the
nature of the rest, the rapidity and certainty of this judgment
proves it to be a mechanical, not a mental act. The
intuition with which a mathematician sees the solution
of a problem would then be a mechanical process, while
the slow and bungling hesitation of the tyro in presence
of the same problem would be a mental process: the perfection
of the organism would thus result in its degradation
to the level of a machine!</p>

<p>The operations of the intellect may furnish us with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
illustration. Ideas are symbols of sensations. The idea
of a horse is an abstraction easily traceable to concrete
sensations, yet as an abstraction is so different a state of
feeling that we only identify it with its concretes by a
careful study of its stages of evolution, namely, sensation,
image, reproduced images resembling yet differing from
the original sensation, a coalescence of their resemblances,
and finally the substitution of a verbal symbol for these
images. With this symbol the intellect operates, and
sometimes operates so exclusively with it that not the
faintest trace of image or sensation is appreciable—the
word horse takes the place of the image in the sequence
of sensorial processes, just as the image takes the place of
the sensation. It does this as a neural equivalent. In
the same way we substitute verbal symbols for a bag of
sovereigns when we pay a creditor with a check; he pays
the check away to another; and this monetary equivalent
passes from hand to hand without a single coin making its
appearance. Does the transaction cease to be commercial,
monetary, in this substitution of signs? No; nor does a
process cease to be psychical when an image is substituted
for a sensation, and a verbal symbol for an image. This
every one will admit. Must we not go further, and extend
the admission to automatic actions which originally
were voluntary, and have now lost all trace of ideal prevision,
and almost all traces of accompanying consciousness?
<i>The motor mechanism has its symbols also</i>; in this
sense, that whereas the action which at first needed complex
sensorial processes to set it going and keep it going,
is now determined by a single one of those processes
taking the place of their resultant. When a practised
accountant runs his eye up a column of figures, he does
not pause to realize the values of those figures by decomposing
the symbols into their numerical units, he simply
groups one symbol with another according to their intuited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
relations, and the final result is reached with a certainty
not less, and a rapidity far greater, than if it had been
reached by step-by-step verification. It is thus with the
pianoforte-player. It is thus with all automatic performances,
except those dependent on the connate adjustments
of the mechanism.</p>

<p>71. <span class="firstword">If</span> the preceding attempt to disengage the question
from the ambiguities of its terms has been successful,
we shall find little difficulty in rationally interpreting all
the facts adduced in favor of Animal Automatism, without
having recourse to a mechanical theory of biological
phenomena. The objections to that theory are that it
employs terms which have very misleading <i>connotations</i>
even when they do not <i>denote</i> phenomena of widely different
orders; so that the moral repugnance commonly felt
at the attempt to treat the animal organism as if it were
a machine, is sustained by the intellectual repugnance at
the attempt to explain biological phenomena on principles
derived from phenomena of a simpler order.</p>

<p>Remark, in passing, this piquant contradiction: the
Automaton theory of Descartes, when applied to the animals,
generally excited ridicule or repulsion; whereas the
far more inconsistent and mechanical theory of Reflex
Action has been almost universally welcomed as a great
discovery, though it banishes the Sensibility which Descartes
preserved. And further, the philosophers who
most loudly protested against the idea that animals were
machines, were the philosophers who most insisted that
these animals were made, not evolved—planned by their
maker, as a watch is planned by its maker, with a distinct
purpose and prevision in the disposition of every
part; whereas the philosophers who most emphatically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
reject this notion of organisms being made, are often
those who liken organisms to machines.</p>

<p>72. The paradox propounded by Descartes loses much
of its strangeness when we understand his meaning. Its
terms are infelicitous because of their misleading connotations.
When he says that all the actions of animals
which seem to be due to Consciousness are in fact produced
on the same principles as those of a machine, he
means that animals have not souls to direct their actions;
but since, on being questioned, he is ready to admit that
animals have sensation, perception, emotion, and memory,
his denial of their souls practically comes to much the
same as the ordinary position that animals have not
Thought nor Consciousness of Self.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The admission of
sensation is, however, quite enough to mark the essential
difference between an organism and a machine.</p>

<p>73. It was really a great step taken by Descartes when
he directed attention to the fact that all animal actions
were executed in strict conformity with mechanical principles,
because both before his time, and since, we may
observe a great disregard of the animal mechanism, and a
disposition to interpret the phenomena on metaphysical
principles. But the connotations of the term “machine”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
were such as to lead the mind away from the special conditions
of the vital mechanism, and fix it exclusively on
the general conditions of machinery. Hence his opponents
misunderstood him, and some of his followers made
the same oversight, and ended by eliminating sensation
altogether. In pursuance of this mechanical point of
view, to the exclusion of the biological, Thought and even
Consciousness have been eliminated from among the organic
agencies, and are said to have no more influence in
determining even human actions than the whistle of the
steam-engine has in directing the locomotive. There are
thus two <i>meta</i>physiological theories. According to the
one, Consciousness directs indeed the actions of the organism,
but is not itself an organic process—it sits apart,
like a musical performer playing on an instrument. According
to the other, it is not a directing agency, but an
accessory product of certain organic processes, which processes
may go on quite as well without any accompaniment
and interference of Consciousness.</p>

<p>74. Two observations arise here. First, we observe a
want of due recognition of the objective and subjective
aspects, and their respective criteria. Secondly, we observe
mental facts of irresistible certainty interpreted by
material hypotheses of questionable value; and not only
so, but a higher validity is assigned to the material
hypotheses than to the mental facts they are invented
to explain. That we are conscious, and that our actions
are determined by sensations, emotions, and ideas, are
facts which may or may not be explained by reference to
material conditions, but which no material explanation
can render more certain. That animals resemble us in
this as in other respects is an induction of the highest
probability. It is also a fact that many actions take
place, as we say, unconsciously and involuntarily; and
that some take place now consciously, now unconsciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
These facts also we endeavor to explain: and when we
find that some of the unconscious and involuntary actions
take place after the brain has been removed, this is interpreted
on the material hypothesis of the brain being the
sole seat of sensation and consciousness; and is urged in
favor of the hypothesis that consciousness cannot be an
agent in the mechanism. Here the confusion of objective
and subjective aspects is patent. Consciousness as a subjective
fact cannot be a material or objective fact. But
may it not be another aspect of that which is objective?
So long as we are dealing with the objective aspect, we
have nothing but material processes in a material mechanism
before us. A change within the organism is caused
by a neural stimulation, and the resulting action is a reflex
on the muscles. Here there is simply a transference
of motion by a material mechanism. There is in this no
evidence of a subjective agency; there could be none.
But when we come to investigate the process, we find
that it differs from similar processes in anorganisms, by
the necessary co-operation of special conditions, and among
these—the vital conditions—there are those which in
their subjective aspect we express not in terms of Matter
and Motion, but in terms of Feeling, i. e. not in objective
but in subjective terms. I see a stone move on being
struck; I also see a man shrink on being struck, and hear
a dog howl on being kicked. I do not infer that the stone
feels as the man and dog feel, because I know the stone and
the dog to be differently constituted, and infer a corresponding
difference in their reactions. I infer that the
man and dog feel, because I know they are like myself,
and conclude that what I feel they feel, under like conditions.</p>

<p>75. Descartes says that animals are sensitive automata.
They <i>always</i> act as we <i>sometimes</i> act, i. e. when we are not
conscious of what we do, as in singing, walking, playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
the piano, etc. We are said to do these things mechanically,
automatically, and hence the conclusion that these
actions are those of a pure mechanism. But it would be
truer to say that we never act mechanically, we always
act organically. “When one who falls from a height
throws his hands forwards to save his head,” says Descartes,
“it is in virtue of no ratiocination that he performs
this action” (that depends on the definition: in the
Logic of Feeling there is a process of ratiocination identical
with that in the Logic of Signs). “It does not
depend upon his <i>mind</i>” (again a question of definition),
“but takes place merely because his senses being affected
by <i>present danger</i>” (senses, then, have a perception of
danger?) “some change arises in his brain which determines
the animal spirits to pass thence into the nerves
in such a manner as is required to produce this motion,
in the same way as in a machine, and without his mind
being able to hinder it. Now since we observe this in
ourselves, why should we be so much astonished if the
light reflected from the body of a wolf into the eye of a
sheep has the same force to excite in it the motion of
flight?”</p>

<p>Here, both in the case of the man and the sheep, there is
presupposed the very mental experience which is denied.
The young child will not throw out its arm to protect
itself; but after many experiences of falling and stumbling,
there is an organized perception of the impending
danger, and the means of averting it, and it is this which
determines the throwing out of the arms. If this is not
a mental fact—a process of judgment—then the logical
conclusion by which a financier on hearing a war rumor
orders his broker to sell stock, is not a mental fact. The
light reflected from the body of a wolf would not disturb
the sheep unless its own, or its <i>inherited</i> organized experience
were ready there to respond. But this organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
experience, you say, enters into the mechanism? Yes;
but it cannot be made to enter into the mechanism of an
automaton, because however complex that mechanism
may be, and however capable of variety of action, it is
constructed solely for definite actions on calculated lines:
all its readjustments must have been foreseen, it is incapable
of adjusting itself to unforeseen circumstances.
Hence every interruption in the prearranged order either
throws it out of gear, or brings it to a standstill. It is
regulated, not self-regulating. The organism, on the contrary—conspicuously
so in its more complex forms—is
variable, self-regulating, incalculable. It has <i>selective
adaptation</i> (p. 221) responding readily and efficiently to
novel and unforeseen circumstances; <i>acquiring</i> new modes
of combination and reaction. An automaton that will
learn by experience, and adapt itself to conditions not
calculated for in its construction, has yet to be made;
till it is made, we must deny that organisms are machines.
Automatism in the organism implies Memory
and Perception. A sudden contact—a sudden noise—a
vague form seen in the twilight will excite the mechanism
according to its organized experiences. We start
automatically, before we automatically interpret the cause;
we start first, and then ask, What is that? But we do
not always start at sounds or sights which have no association
with previous experiences. The child and the man
both see the falling glass, but the child does not automatically
stretch out a hand to save the glass. Having once
learned the action of swimming or billiard-playing, we
automatically execute these; without consciously remembering
the rules, we unconsciously obey them; each feeling
as it rises is linked on to another, each muscle is
combined with others in a remembered synthesis.</p>

<p>76. Kempelen’s chess-player surprised the public, but
every instructed physiologist present knew that in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
way or other its movements were directed by a human
mind; simply because no machine could possibly have
responded to the unforeseen fluctuations of the human
mind opposed to it. Even the mind of a dog or a savage
would be incompetent to pass beyond the range of its previous
experiences, incompetent to seize the significance
of an adversary’s moves on the chessboard. Now just as
we conclude that mental agency is essential to a game
of chess, so we conclude that Sensibility is essential to
the fluctuating responses of an organism under unforeseen
circumstances. We can conceive an automaton dog that
would bark at the presence of a beggar; but not of an automaton
dog that would bark one day at the beggar and the
next day wag his tail, remembering the food and patting
that beggar had bestowed. Since all we know of machines
forbids the idea of their being capable of adjusting their
actions to new circumstances, or of evoking through experience
new powers of combination, we conclude that
wherever this capability of adaptation is present there is
an agency in operation which does not belong to the
class of mechanical agencies. Goltz has shown that a frog
deprived of its brain manifests so much of vision as enables
it to avoid obstacles—leaping to the right or to
the left of a book placed in its path. This Professor
Huxley regards as purely mechanical:—“Although the
frog appears to have no sensation of light, visible objects
act upon the motor mechanism of its body.” Should we
not rather conclude that if the frog had no sensation, no
such effect would follow? because although a machine
<i>might</i> be constructed to respond to variations of light and
shadows, none could be constructed (without Sensibility)
to respond to the fluctuating conditions as an organism
responds.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Were the reflex actions of the organism purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
mechanical—i. e. involving none of those fluctuating
adjustments which characterize Sensibility—the effect
would be uniform, and proportional to the impact; but it
is variable, and proportional to the static condition of the
nervous centres at the moment. Exaggerate this—by
strychnine, for instance—and the slightest touch on the
skin will produce general convulsions. Lower it—by an
anæsthetic—and no reflex at all will follow a stimulus.
In anæsthesia of the mucous membrane, no reflex of the
eyelid, no secretion of tears, follows on the irritation of
the membrane; no sneezing follows irritation of the inside
of the nose; no vomiting follows irritation of the
fauces.</p>

<p>77. The question has long ceased to be whether the
organism is a mechanism. To the physiologist it is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
before all things. To the psychologist also it has of late
years more and more assumed this character; because even
when he postulates the existence of a spiritual entity <i>in</i>
the organism but not <i>of</i> it, he still recognizes the necessity
of a mechanism for the execution of the acts determined
by the spirit; and when the psychologist adopts
the theory of spiritual phenomena as the subjective aspect
of what objectively are material phenomena, he of course
regards the bodily mechanism and the mental mechanism
as one and the same real.</p>

<p>This settled, the problem of Automatism may be thus
stated: Granting the animal organism to be a material
mechanism, and all its actions due to the operation of
that mechanism, are we to conclude that it is an automaton
essentially resembling the automata we construct,
the movements of which may, or may not, be <i>accompanied</i>
by Feeling, but are in no case <i>determined</i> by Feeling?</p>

<p>Descartes says that animals are sensitive automata.
Professor Huxley says that both animals and men are
sensitive and conscious automata; so that misleading as
the language of Descartes and Professor Huxley often
is in what its terms connote, we do them great injustice if
we suppose them to have overlooked the points of difference
between organisms and machines which have been
set forth with so much emphasis in a preceding chapter;
and the reader is requested to understand that without
pretending to say how much the inevitable connotation
of their language expresses their opinions, and how much
it may have only led to their being misunderstood, my
criticisms are directed against this connotation and this
interpretation.</p>

<p>78. <span class="firstword">Descartes</span> having attributed all animal actions to
a sensitive mechanism, and indeed all human actions to a
similar mechanism, endeavored to reconcile this hypothesis
with the irresistible facts of Consciousness—which
assured us that <i>our</i> actions, at least, were determined by
Feeling. To this end he assumed that man had a spiritual
principle over and above the sentient principle. The
operation of this principle was, however, limited to Thought;
the actions themselves were all performed by the automatic
mechanism; so that, in strict logic, the conclusion
from his premises was the same for man as for animals.</p>

<p>This conclusion Professor Huxley announced in his
Address before the British Association, 1874<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>—to the
great scandal of the general public, which did not understand
him aright; and to the scandal also of a physiological
public, which, strangely enough, failed to see that it
was the legitimate expression of one of their favorite
theories—the celebrated Reflex Theory. Now although
it is quite open to any one to reject the premises which
lead to such a conclusion, if he sees greater evidence
against the conclusion than for the premises, it is surely
irrational to accept the premises as those of scientific induction,
and yet reject the conclusion because it endangers
the stability of other opinions? For my own part,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
I do not accept the premises, and my polemic will have
reference to them.</p>

<p>79. Professor Huxley adopts certain Theses which
represent the views generally adopted by physiologists;
to which he adds a Thesis which is adopted by few, and
which he only puts forward hypothetically. Against
these positions I place Antitheses, less generally adopted,
but which in my belief approximate more nearly to the
inductions of experience.</p>

80. The first four Theses are those current in our textbooks,
so that it is only the fifth which will have the air
of a paradox. Nor, as a paradox, is it without advocates.
Schiff long ago suggested it hypothetically. Hermann
mentions it as entertained by physiologists, whom he
does not name.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> Laycock, and, if I remember rightly,
Dr. Drysdale, have insisted on it; and Mr. Spalding has
proclaimed it with iterated emphasis. Of the Antitheses
nothing need be said here, since the whole of this volume
is meant to furnish their evidence.</p>

<p>I have already stated that my polemic is against the
views that Professor Huxley is <i>supposed</i> to hold by those
whom his expressions mislead, rather than against the
views I imagine him really to hold. I have little doubt
that he would disavow much that I am forced to combat,
although his language is naturally interpreted in that
sense. But I do not know in how far he would agree
with me, and in the following remarks I shall confine
myself to what seems to be the plain interpretation of his
words, since <i>that</i> is the interpretation which has been
generally adopted, and which I most earnestly desire
to refute.</p>

<p>81. To begin with this passage. After stating the
views of Descartes, he says: “As actions of a certain degree
of complexity are brought about by mere mechanism,
why may not actions of still greater complexity be the
result of a more refined mechanism? What proof is there
that brutes are other than a superior race of marionnettes,
which eat without pleasure, cry without pain, desire nothing,
know nothing, and only simulate intelligence as a
bee simulates a mathematician?” What proof? Why,
in the first place, the proof which is implied in the “more
refined mechanism” required for the greater complexity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
of actions. In the next place, the proof that the organism
of the brute is very different from the mechanism of a
marionnette, and is so much more like the organism of
man, that since we know man to eat with pleasure and
cry with pain, there is a strong presumption that the
brute eats and cries with somewhat similar feelings.</p>

<p>82. Having stated the hypothesis, Professor Huxley
says he is not disposed to accept it, though he thinks it
cannot be refuted. His chief reason for not accepting
it is that the law of continuity forbids the supposition of
any complex phenomenon suddenly appearing; the community
between animals and men is too close for us to
admit that Consciousness could appear in man without
having its beginnings in animals. Finding that animals
have brains, he justly concludes that they also must have
brain functions; and they also therefore must be credited
with Consciousness. This argument seems to me to have
irresistible cogency; and to be destructive not only of the
automaton hypothesis, but equally of the hypothesis on
which the Reflex Theory is founded. If the law of continuity
forbids the sudden appearance of Consciousness,
the law of similarity of property with similarity of structure
forbids the supposition that central nerve-tissue in
one part of the system can suddenly assume a totally
different property in another part. If the brain of an
animal, a bird, a reptile, or a fish—and <i>a fortiori</i> if the
œsophageal ganglia of an insect or a mollusc—may be
credited with Sensibility, because of the fundamental
similarity of these structures with the structures of the
human brain, then surely the spinal cord must be credited
with Sensibility; for the tissue of the spinal cord is more
like that of the brain, than the brain of a reptile is like
the brain of a man. The sudden disappearance of all Sensibility,
on the removal of one portion of the central nervous
system, would be a violation of the law of continuity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
And if it be said that Consciousness is not the same as
Sensibility, but is a specially evolved function of a specially
developed organ, the answer will be that this is only
a difference of mode, and that the existence of Sensibility
is that which renders the automaton and reflex theories
untenable.</p>

<p>83. Professor Huxley would probably admit this; for
however his language may at times seem to point to
another conclusion, and is so far ambiguous, he has expressed
the view here maintained with tolerable distinctness
in the following passage, to which particular attention
is <span class="locked">called:—</span></p>

<p>“But though we may see reason to disagree with Descartes’
hypothesis, that brutes are unconscious machines,
it does not follow that he was wrong in regarding them
as automata. <i>They may be more or less conscious sensitive
automata</i>; and the view that they are such conscious
machines is that which is implicitly or explicitly adopted
by most persons. When we speak of the actions of the
lower animals being guided by instinct and not by reason,
what we really mean is that though they feel as we do,
yet their actions are the results of their physical organization.
We believe, in short, that they are machines, one
part of which (the nervous system) not only sets the rest
in motion and co-ordinates its movements in relation with
changes in surrounding bodies, but is provided with a
special apparatus the function of which is the calling into
existence of those states of consciousness which are termed
sensations, emotions, and ideas.”</p>

<p>84. To say that they are “conscious automata” seems
granting all that I demand; but there are two objectionable
positions which the phrase conceals: first, that Consciousness
is not a coefficient; and secondly, that Reflex
Action is purely mechanical.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley nowhere, I think, establishes the distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
between Consciousness as a term for a special
mode of Feeling, and Consciousness as the all-embracing
term for sentient phenomena. His language always implies
that an action performed unconsciously is performed
mechanically; which may be acceptable if by unconsciously
be meant insentiently. I hold that whether
consciously or unconsciously performed, the action is
equally vital and sentient. In the case he has cited of
a soldier now living who is subject to periodic alternations
of normal and abnormal states, in the latter states
all the actions being said to be “unconscious,” we have
only to read the account to recognize ample evidence of
Sentience. Here is a descriptive <span class="locked">passage:—</span></p>

<p>85. “His [the soldier’s in the abnormal state] movements
remain free, and his expression calm, except for a
contraction of the brow, an incessant movement of the
eyeballs, and a chewing motion of the jaws. The eyes
are wide open, and their pupils dilated. If the man happens
to be in a place to which he is accustomed he walks
about as usual; but if he is in a new place, or if obstacles
are intentionally placed in his way, he stumbles against
them, <i>stops, and then feeling over the objects with his hands,
passes on one side of them</i>. He offers no resistance to any
change of direction which may be impressed upon him,
or to the forcible acceleration or retardation of his movements.
He eats, drinks, smokes, walks about, dresses and
undresses himself, rises and goes to bed at the accustomed
hours. Nevertheless pins may be run into his
body, or strong electric shocks sent through it, without
causing the least indication of pain; no odorous substance,
pleasant or unpleasant, makes the least impression; he
eats and drinks with avidity whatever is offered, and
takes asafœtida or vinegar of quinine as readily as water;
no noise affects him; and light influences him only under
certain conditions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
There is no one of these phenomena that is unfamiliar
to students of mental disease. The case is chiefly remarkable
from the periodicity of the recurrence of the
abnormal state. I have collected other cases of the kind,
and may hereafter find a fitting occasion to quote them.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
The anæsthesia and “unconsciousness” noted, no more
prove the actions performed by this soldier to have been
purely mechanical, i. e. undetermined by sensation, than
anæsthesia and unconsciousness prove somnambulists and
madmen to be machines. In the pathological state called
“ecstasy” there is a considerable diminution of sensibility
to external stimuli; with a concentration on certain
feelings, images, trains of thought, exhibiting itself in
expressions of emotion. “Les malades,” says a master,
“paraissent entièrement absorbés par leurs mouvements
intérieurs, ils refusent généralement de manger, et spécialement
la volonté de l’âme semble complètement enchainée.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>86. Observe that while this soldier exhibits such insensibility
to certain stimuli, he unequivocally exhibits
sensibility to other stimuli. All his acts show sense-guidance.
Sight and Touch obviously regulate his movements.
And when he feels objects placed in his way,
and then passes beside them, wherein does this differ
from the normal procedure of sensitive organisms? wherein
does it resemble automata? Dr. Mesmet—from whose
narrative the case is cited—remarks that the sense of
Touch seems to persist “and indeed to be more acute and
delicate than in the normal state”; upon which Professor
Huxley has this comment:—“Here a difficulty arises.
It is clear from the facts detailed that the nervous apparatus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
by which in the normal state sensations of touch
are excited is that by which external influences determine
the movements of the body in the abnormal state. But
does the state of consciousness, which we term a tactile
sensation, accompany the operation of this nervous apparatus
in the abnormal state? or is consciousness utterly
absent, the man being reduced to a pure mechanism? It
is impossible to obtain direct evidence in favor of the one
conclusion or the other; all that can be said is that the
case of the frog shows that the man may be devoid of any
kind of consciousness.”</p>

<p>87. It is here we are made vividly aware of the absolute
need there is to disengage the terms employed from
their common ambiguities. All the evidence of a tactile
sensation which can possibly be furnished, on the objective
side, is furnished by the actions of this soldier; to
doubt it would be to throw a doubt on the sensibility of
any animal unable to <i>tell</i> us what it felt; nay, even a
man if he were dumb, or spoke a language we could not
understand, could give us no other proof. We conclude
that the soldier had tactile sensations, because we see him
guided by them as we ourselves are guided by tactile sensations;
we know that he is an organism, not a machine, and
therefore reject the inference that he has become reduced
to a “pure mechanism” because it is inferred that his
consciousness is absent. And on what is this inference
grounded? 1°, The belief that the brain is the sole organ
of consciousness (Sentience)—a belief flatly disproved
by the facts, which show Sentience when the brain has
been removed; and 2°, the belief that the decapitated frog,
because it avoids obstacles and redirects its leaps to avoid
them, does so without Sentience. According to the definition
we adopt, we may either say that the decapitated
frog, and the soldier in his abnormal state, act without
consciousness, or with it. But what does not seem permissible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
is to deny that their actions exhibit the clearest
evidence of <i>sense-guidance</i>, and the kind of volition which
this sense-guidance implies; and this is quite enough to
separate them from actions of automata. When a man
ducks his head to avoid a stone which he sees falling
towards him, he assuredly has a sensation, i. e. there is a
grouping of neural elements, which subjectively is a sensation,
and this originates a grouping of other neural
elements, the outcome of which is a muscular movement,
which subjectively is a motor sensation: <i>this</i> grouping
would not have been originated unless the particular
grouping had preceded it; nor would the simple retinal
stimulus have excited this sensation unless the nerve-centres
had been attuned to such response by many previous
experiences: the ignorant child would not duck its
head on seeing the stone approach. In our familiar use
of the word Consciousness it would be correct to say that
the man ducks his head “unconsciously”; and yet expressing
the fact in psychological language, we also say:
He ducks his head because <i>remembering</i> the pain of
former similar experiences, he <i>knows</i> that if the stone
strikes him he will again be hurt as before, therefore he
<i>wills</i> to avoid it; expressing it in physiological language
we may say: The man acts thus because he is so organized
that a particular neural process is the stimulus of a
particular central discharge; and he became thus organized
through a long series of anterior adjustments responding
to stimuli, each adjustment being the activity
of the vital organism.</p>

<p>88. There can be no doubt that the soldier had perceptions,
and that these perceptions guided his movements;
whether these shall be called “states of consciousness”
or not, is a question of terms. Now since we know
that <i>certain actions are uniformly consequent on certain
perceptions</i>, we are justified in inferring that <i>whenever the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
actions are performed, the perceptions preceded them</i>: this
inference may be erroneous, but in the absence of positive
evidence to the contrary it is that which claims our first
assent. Is it evidence to the contrary that the perception
may have stimulated the action, yet been unaccompanied
by the special mode named consciousness? Not in the
least. We learn to read with conscious effort; each letter
has to be apprehended separately, its form distinguished
from all other forms, its value as a sign definitely fixed,
yet how very rarely are we “conscious” of the letters
when we read a book? Each letter is perceived; and yet
this process passes so rapidly and smoothly, that unless
there be some defect in a letter, or the word be misspelled,
we are not “conscious” of the perceptions. Are
we therefore reading automata?<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>We are said to walk unconsciously at times; and the
continuance of the movement is said to be due to reflex
action. But it is demonstrable that the cutaneous sensibility
of the soles of the feet is a primary condition. If
the skin be insensible, the walking becomes a stumble.
In learning to walk, or dance, the child fixes his eyes on
his feet, as he fixes them on his fingers in learning to
play the piano. After a while these registered sensations
<i>connected</i> with the muscular sense suffice to guide his feet
or his fingers; but not if feet or fingers lose their sensibility.</p>

<p>89. With these explanations let us follow the further
details of this soldier’s abnormal <span class="locked">actions:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
“The man is insensible to sensory impressions made
through the ear, the nose, the tongue, and, to a great extent,
the eye; nor is he susceptible to pain from causes
operating during his abnormal state. Nevertheless it is
possible <i>so to act upon his tactile apparatus as to give rise
to those molecular changes in his sensorium which are ordinarily
the causes of associated trains of ideas</i>. I give a
striking example of this process in Dr. Mesmet’s words:
‘Il se promenait dans le jardin, on lui remet sa canne
qu’il avait laissé tomber. Il la palpe, promène à plusieurs
reprises la main sur la poignée coudée de sa
canne—devient attentif—semble prêter l’oreille—et
tout à coup appelle, “Henri! les voilà!” Et alors portant
la main derrière son dos comme pour prendre une
cartouche, il fait le mouvement de charger son arme, se
couche dans l’herbe à plat ventre dans la position d’un
tirailleur, et suit avec l’arme épaulée tous les mouvements
de l’ennemi qu’il croit voir à courte distance.’ In
a subsequent abnormal period Dr. Mesmet caused the
patient to repeat this scene by placing him in the same
conditions. Now in this case the question arises whether
the series of actions constituting this singular pantomime
was accompanied by the ordinary states of consciousness,
the appropriate trains of ideas, or not? Did the man
dream that he was skirmishing? or was he in the condition
of one of Vaucanson’s automata—<i>a mechanism
worked by molecular changes in the nervous system</i>? The
analogy of the frog shows that the latter assumption is
perfectly justifiable.”</p>

<p>90. Before criticising this conclusion let me adduce
other illustrations of this dreamlike activity. “A gentleman
whom I attended in a state of perfect apoplexy,”
says Abercrombie, “was frequently observed to adjust his
nightcap with the utmost care when it got into an uncomfortable
state: first pulling it down over his eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
then turning up the front of it in the most exact manner.”
According to the current teaching, these actions,
which seem like evidence of sensation, are nothing of the
kind, because—the patient was “unconscious”; that is
to say, because he did not exhibit one complex kind of
Sensibility, it is denied that he exhibited another kind!
he did not feel discomfort, nor feel the movements by
which it was rectified—because he could not speak, discuss
impersonal questions, nor attend to what was said to
him! Abercrombie cites other cases: “A gentleman who
was lying in a <i>state of perfect insensibility</i> from disease of
the brain” (note the phrase, which really only expresses
the fact that external stimuli did not create their normal
reactions) “was frequently observed even the day before
his death to take down a repeating watch from a little
bag at the head of his bed, put it close to his ear and
make it strike the hour, and then replace it in the bag
with the greatest precision. Another whom I saw in a
state of profound apoplexy, from which he recovered,
had a perfect recollection of what took place during the
attack, and mentioned many things which had been said
in his hearing when he was supposed to be in a state of
perfect unconsciousness.” Dr. Wigan also tells of a lady
whom he knew, and who was actually put in a coffin,
under the belief that she was dead when in a trance.
Her sense of hearing was then preternaturally acute.
In her second-floor bedroom she heard what the servants
said in her kitchen. When her brother came to
see her and he declared she should not be buried until
putrefaction set in, she felt intense gratitude and a gush
of tenderness, but was unable to move even an eyelid as
a manifestation of her feeling. Suddenly all her faculties
returned. Dr. Wigan adds that he visited the Countess
Escalante, one of the Spanish refugees, who remained in
a similar state for a short period, during which she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
her husband and children, and was quite conscious of all
they did and said—but did not recognize them as her
own. She was absolutely without the power of moving
a finger or of opening her mouth. Dr. Neil Arnott told
me of a similar case in his practice. In these last cases
we learn that consciousness—in its ordinary acceptation—was
present, though bystanders could see no trace
of it. And very often in cases where Consciousness, or
at any rate Sensibility, is clearly manifested, its presence
is denied, because the patient on recovering his normal
condition is quite unable to remember anything that he
felt and did. Under anæsthetics patients manifest sensation,
but on awaking they declare that they felt nothing—of
what value is their declaration? M. Despine tells
us of a patient who under chloroform struggled, swore,
and cried out, “<i>Mon Dieu! que je souffre!</i>” yet when the
operation was over, and he emerged from the effects of
the chloroform, he remembered nothing of what he had
felt.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>91. Returning now to Dr. Mesmet’s soldier, and to the
conclusion that his dreamlike acts were no more than the
actions of one of Vaucanson’s automata, surely we are
justified in concluding, first, that these actions were not
of the same kind as those of an automaton, since they
were those of a living organism; secondly, that they present
all the evidence positive and inferential which Sensibility
can present in the actions we observe in another,
and do not feel in ourselves; and thirdly, if with physiologists
we agree that the mechanism of these actions is
“worked by molecular changes in the nervous system,”
there is some difficulty in understanding how Consciousness,
which is said to be caused by such changes, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
have been absent—how the <i>cause could operate yet no
effect be produced</i>.</p>

<p>92. What automata can be made to perform is surprising
enough, but they can <i>never</i> be made to display
the fluctuations of sense-guided actions, such as we see in
the report of Dr. Mesmet’s <span class="locked">soldier:—</span></p>

<p>“The ex-sergeant has a good voice, and had at one time
been employed as a singer at a café. In one of his abnormal
states he was observed to begin humming a tune.
He then went to his room, dressed himself carefully, and
took up some parts of a periodical novel which lay on the
bed, as <i>if he were trying to find something</i>. Dr. Mesmet,
suspecting that he was seeking his music, made up one
of these into a roll and put it into his hand. <i>He appeared</i>
satisfied, took up his cane, and went down stairs
to the door. Here Dr. Mesmet turned him round, and
he walked quite contentedly in the opposite direction.
The <i>light of the sun</i> shining through a window happened
to fall upon him, and <i>seemed to suggest the footlights of the
stage</i> on which he was accustomed to make his appearance.
He stopped, opened his roll of imaginary music,
put himself in the attitude of a singer, and sang with
perfect execution three songs one after the other. After
which he wiped his face with his handkerchief and drank
without a grimace a tumbler of strong vinegar-and-water.”</p>

<p>93. Epileptic patients have frequently been observed
going through similar dreamlike actions in which only
those external stimuli which have a relation to the dream
seem to take effect.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> We interpret these as phenomena
of <i>disordered</i> mental action, the burden of proof lies on
him who says they are phenomena of pure mechanism.
A mail-coach does not suddenly cease to be a mail-coach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
and become a wheelbarrow because the coachman is
drunk, or has fallen from the box. The horses, no longer
guided by the reins, may dash off the highroad into gardens
or ditches; but it is their muscular exertions which
still move the coach.</p>

<p>Can any one conceive an automaton acting as the sergeant
is described to be in the following passage?—</p>

<p>“Sitting at a table he took up a pen, felt for paper and
ink, and began to write a letter to his general, in which
he <i>recommended himself for a medal</i> on account of his
good conduct and courage. It occurred to Dr. Mesmet to
ascertain experimentally how far vision was concerned
in this act of writing. He therefore interposed a screen between
the man’s eyes and his hands; under these circumstances
he <i>went on writing for a short time, but the words became
illegible, and he finally stopped</i>. On the withdrawal
of the screen, he <i>began to write again where he had left off</i>.
The substitution of water for ink in the inkstand had a
similar result. He stopped, <i>looked at his pen, wiped it on
his coat</i>, dipped it in the water, and began again, with the
same effect. On one occasion he began to write upon the
topmost of ten superposed sheets of paper. After he had
written a line or two, this sheet was suddenly drawn
away. <i>There was a slight expression of surprise</i>, but he
continued his letter on the second sheet exactly as if it
had been the first. This operation was repeated five
times, so that the fifth sheet contained nothing but the
writer’s signature at the bottom of the page. Nevertheless,
when the signature was finished, his eyes turned to
the top of the blank sheet, and he went through the form
of reading over what he had written, a movement of the
lips accompanying each word; moreover, with his pen <i>he
put in such corrections as were needed</i>.”</p>

<p>94. Dr. Mesmet concludes that “his patient sees some
things and not others; that the sense of sight is accessible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
to all things which are brought into relation with him by
the sense of touch, and, on the contrary, is insensible
to things which lie outside this relation.” In other
words, the sensitive mechanism acts, but acts abnormally.
This is precisely what is observed in somnambulists. Yet
Professor Huxley, who makes the comparison, appears to
regard both states as those in which the organism is reduced
to a mere mechanism, because on recovering their
normal state the patients are unconscious of what has
passed; and because the frog, without its brain, also manifests
analogous phenomena. Neither premise warrants
the conclusion. I have already touched on the unconsciousness
of past actions; let me add the case of Faraday,
who was assuredly not an automaton when he prepared
and delivered a course of lectures which were nevertheless
so entirely obliterated from his memory that the next
year he prepared and delivered the same course once more,
without a suspicion that it was not a new one. As to
the frog, I must leave that case till I come to examine the
evidence on which the hypothesis of the purely mechanical
nature of spinal action rests.</p>

<p>95. The point never to be left out of sight is that
actions which are known to be preceded and accompanied
by sensations do not lose their special character of Sentience,
as actions of a sentient mechanism, because they are
not also preceded and accompanied by that peculiar state
which is specially called Consciousness, i. e. attention to
the passing changes (comp. p. 403). When we see a man
playing the piano, and at the same time talking of something
far removed from the music, we say his fingers
move unconsciously; but we do not conclude that he is a
musical machine—muscular sensations and musical sensations
regulate every movement of his fingers; and if he
strikes a false note, or if one of the notes jangles, he is
instantly conscious of the fact. Either we must admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
that his brain is an essential part of the mechanism by
which the piano was played, and its function an essential
agent in the playing; or else we must admit that the
brain and its function were not essential, and therefore
the playing would continue if the brain were removed.
In the latter case, we should have a musical automaton.
That a particular group of sensations, such as musical
tones, will set going a particular group of muscular movements,
without the intervention of any <i>conscious</i> effort, is
not more to be interpreted on purely mechanical principles,
than that a particular phrase will cause a story-teller
to repeat a familiar anecdote, or an old soldier “to
fight his battles o’er again.”</p>

<p>96. Let us now pass to another consideration, namely,
whether Consciousness—however interpreted—is legitimately
conceived as a factor in the so-called conscious
and voluntary actions; or is merely a <i>collateral result</i> of
certain organic activities? To answer this, we must first
remember that Consciousness is a purely subjective process;
although we may believe it to be objectively a neural
process, we are nevertheless passing out of the region of
Physiology when we speak of Feeling determining Action.
Motion may determine Motion; but Feeling can only
determine Feeling. Yet we do so speak, and are justified.
For thereby we implicitly declare, what Psychology explicitly
teaches, namely, that these two widely different
aspects, objective and subjective, are but the two faces of
one and the same reality. It is thus indifferent whether
we say a sensation is a neural process, or a mental process:
a molecular change in the nervous system, or a change in
Feeling. It is either, and it is both, as I have elsewhere
explained.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> There it was argued that the current hypothesis
of a neural process <i>causing</i> the mental process—molecular
movement being in some mysterious way <i>transformed</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
into sensation—is not only inconceivable, but
altogether unnecessary; whereas the hypothesis that the
two aspects of the one phenomenon are simply two different
expressions, now in terms of Matter and Motion, and
now in terms of Consciousness, is in harmony with all
the inductive evidence.</p>

<p>97. “It may be assumed,” says Professor Huxley, “that
molecular changes in the brain are the causes of all the
states of consciousness of brutes. Is there any evidence
that these states of consciousness may conversely cause
those molecular changes which give rise to muscular
motion? I see no such evidence. The frog walks, hops,
swims, and goes through his gymnastic performances,
quite as well without consciousness, and consequently
without volition, as with it; and if a frog in his natural
state possesses anything corresponding with what we call
volition, there is no reason to think that <i>it is anything but
a concomitant of the molecular changes in the brain</i>, which
<i>form part of the series involved in the production of motion</i>.
The consciousness of brutes would appear to be related
to the mechanism of their body simply as a collateral
product of its working, and to be <i>as completely without any
power of modifying that working as the steam-whistle which
accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence
upon its machinery</i>. Their volition, if they have
any, is an emotion <i>indicative</i> of physical changes, not a
<i>cause</i> of such changes.” Particular attention is called to
the passages in italics. In the first is expressed a view
which seems not unlike the one I am advocating, but
which is contradicted by the second. Let us consider
what is implied.</p>

<p>98. When Consciousness is regarded solely under its
subjective aspect there is obviously no place for it among
material agencies, regarded as objective. So long as we
have the material mechanism in view we have nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
but material changes. This applies to the frog, with or
without its brain; to man, supposed to be moved by volition,
or supposed to move automatically. The introduction
of Consciousness is not the introduction of another
agent in the series, but of a new aspect; the neural
process drops out of sight, the mental process replaces it.
The question whether we have any ground for inferring
that in the series there is included the particular neural
state which subjectively is a state of Consciousness, must
be answered according to the evidence. Well, the evidence
shows that the actions do involve the co-operation;
and this Professor Huxley expresses when he says that the
molecular changes in the brain form part of the series involved
in the production of motion. Whether we regard
the process objectively as a series of molecular changes,
or subjectively as a succession of sentient changes, the
sum of which is on the one side a motor impulse, on the
other a state of consciousness, we must declare Consciousness
to be an agent, <i>in the same sense that we declare one
change in the organism to be an agent in some other change</i>.
The facts are the same, whether we express them in
physiological or in psychological terms. The physiologist,
having only the material aspect of the organism in
view, says, “A cerebral process initiates a motor process”;
the psychologist says, “A sensation determines an action.”
Unless the two processes have been linked together by
an organic disposition, native or acquired, there will be no
such motor process following the cerebral process. A dog
standing outside the gate is unable to ring the bell, though
having seen another dog ring it, he may wish to do so;
but the cerebral process (his wish) is not linked on to the
needful motor process—he has not learned to realize
the wish; whereas the other dog, having by trial hit upon
the right mode of directing his muscles, has registered this
experience, and can ring the bell. The organized disposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
which enables the dog to do this may truly enough
be called a modification of the mechanism; but what we
have here to note is that a sensation originally determined
the movement, and always determines it.</p>

<p>99. It is the unfortunate ambiguity of the word Consciousness,
and the questionable hypothesis of the brain
being the sole seat of Sensibility, which darken this investigation.
Because animals, after the brain has been
removed, are seen to perform certain actions as deftly as
before, they are said to perform these without the intervention
of Consciousness; when all that is proved by the
facts is that these actions are performed without the intervention
of the brain. In support of this explanation,
examples are cited of unconscious actions performed by
human beings. But if we assign Sensibility not to one
part of the nervous system exclusively, but to the whole,
we can readily understand how the loss of a part will
be manifested by very marked changes in the reactions
of the whole, and yet not altogether prevent the reactions
of the parts remaining intact. An animal must respond
somewhat differently with and without a brain. One
marked difference is the spontaneity of the actions when
the brain is intact, and the loss of much spontaneity
when the brain is injured or removed. Cerebral processes
prompt and regulate actions, as the pressure of the driver
on the reins prompts and regulates the movements of the
horses; but the carriage is moved by the horses and not
by the driver; and the action is executed by the motor
mechanism, whether the incitation arise in a cerebral
process or a peripheral stimulation.</p>

<p>100. If we admit that Consciousness is itself an organic
process, accompanying the molecular changes as a convex
surface accompanies a concave, we must also admit that
its fluctuations are adjustments and readjustments of the
organic mechanism, and that the actions are the effects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
of these—their resultants. The loss of the brain must
obviously cause a great disturbance in these adjustments.
We may call that a loss of Consciousness, if we choose
to limit the term to one <i>mode</i> of sentient reaction. But
this loss of a mode does not change those reactions which
persist so as to convert them into purely mechanical reactions.
A troop of soldiers may have lost its directing
officer, but will fight with the old weapons and the old
intelligence, though not with the same convergence of
individual efforts. A frog or a pigeon no more acts as
<i>well</i> without a brain as with a brain, than the troop of
soldiers fights as well without an officer.</p>

<p>101. Having thus claimed a place for Consciousness in
the series of organic processes, let us now see whether
it has a place among the active agencies. According to
Professor Huxley it is not itself an agent, but only the
“collateral product of the working of the machine.” It
accompanies actions, it does not direct them. It is an
index, not a cause.</p>

<p>Surely it seems more accurate to say that it accompanies
<i>and</i> directs the working? It accompanies the working
in two senses: first, as the subjective aspect of the
objective process; secondly, as the change which produces
a subsequent change, that is to say, the movements
initiated by a feeling are themselves also <i>felt as they pass</i>;
and this feeling enters into the general stream of simultaneous
excitations out of which new movements and feelings
arise; or to express it physiologically, the sensory
impressions determine muscular movements, which in
turn react on the nerve-centres, and these reactions blend
with the general excitation of reflected and re-reflected
processes.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Since every change in Consciousness is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
change in the sentient organism, which objectively is
a change in the nervous centres, the working of the
mechanism being itself a dependent series of such changes,
each movement must have a reflected influence on the
general state. This reflected influence may be viewed as
a collateral product of the working; but there is no real
analogy between it and the whistle of the steam-engine,
because this reflected influence demonstrably <i>does</i> intervene
in the <i>subsequent</i> movements. The feeling which
accompanies or follows a particular movement cannot
indeed modify <i>that</i> movement, since that is already set
going, or has passed; here there is some analogy to the
steam-whistle; but the analogy fails in the subsequent
history: no movements whatever of the steam-engine are
modified by the whistle which accompanies the working
of that engine; yet how the reflected influence modifies
the working of the organism! If the hand be passing
over a surface, there is, accompanying this movement, a
succession of muscular and tactile feelings which may be
said to be collateral products. But the feeling which <i>accompanies</i>
one muscular contraction <i>is itself the stimulus</i> of
the next contraction; if anywhere during the passage the
hand comes upon a spot on the surface which is wet or
rough, the change in feeling thus produced, although a collateral
product of the movement, instantly changes the direction
of the hand, suspends or alters the course—that is
to say, the <i>collateral product of one movement becomes a directing
factor in the succeeding movement</i>. Now this is precisely
what no automaton can effect, unless for changes
that are prearranged. A steam-engine drives its locomotive
over the rails, be they smooth or rough, entire or
broken; it whistles as it goes, but no whistling directs
and redirects its path.</p>

<p>102. Volition is said to be an “emotion indicative of
physical changes, not a cause of such changes.” Here it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
is necessary to understand in what sense the term cause
is employed. I should prefer stating the proposition
thus: a volition is a state of the sentient organism, indicative
of physical changes which have taken place, and
of changes which will take place. Because it is the <i>expression</i>
of the first group of changes, it cannot be their
<i>origin</i>; but it can be, and is the origin of the second
group, which it initiates. The indignation excited by an
insult or a blow is not the origin of the emotion or the
pain, but it is the origin of the actions which are prompted
by this sentient state. In fact no sooner do we admit
that the organism is a sentient mechanism, than the conclusion
is irresistible that Sensibility is a factor in the
working of that mechanism.</p>

<p>103. “Much ingenious argument,” says Professor Huxley,
“has at various times been bestowed upon the question:
How is it possible to imagine that volition which
is a state of consciousness, and as such has not the slightest
community of nature with matter and motion, can
act upon the moving matter of which the body is composed,
as it is assumed to do in voluntary acts? But if,
as is here suggested, the voluntary acts of brutes—or
in other words, the acts which they desire to perform—are
as purely mechanical as the rest of their actions, and
are simply accompanied by the state of consciousness
called volition, the inquiry, so far as they are concerned,
becomes superfluous. Their volitions do not enter into
the chain of causation of their actions at all.... As
consciousness is brought into existence only as the consequence
of molecular motion in the brain, it follows that
it is an indirect product of material changes. The soul
stands related to the body as the bell of a clock to the
works, and consciousness answers to the sound which the
bell gives out when it is struck.” This has been answered
in the foregoing pages; nor do I think the reader who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
has recognized the ambiguity of the term Consciousness,
and the desirability of replacing it in this discussion by
the less equivocal term Sentience, will need more to be
said.</p>

<p>104. The important question whether reflex actions are
insentient, and therefore mechanical, will occupy us in the
next problem. The question of Automatism which has
been argued in the preceding chapters, may, I think, be
summarily disposed of by a reference to the irresistible
evidence each man carries in his own consciousness that
his actions are frequently—even if not always—determined
by feelings. He is quite certain that he is not an
automaton, and that his feelings are not simply collateral
products of his actions, without the power of modifying
and originating them. Now this fundamental fact cannot
be displaced by any theoretical explanation of its factors.
Nor would this fundamental truth be rendered doubtful,
even supposing we were to grant to the full all that is
adduced as evidence that <i>some</i> actions were the result of
purely mechanical processes without sentience at all. I
am a conscious organism, even if it be true that I sometimes
act unconsciously. I am not a machine, even if it
be true that I sometimes act mechanically.</p>

<p>1. <span class="firstword">The</span> peculiarity of the Reflex Theory is its exclusion
of Sensibility from the actions classed as reflex; in consequence
of which, the actions are considered to be “purely
mechanical.”</p>

<p>No one denies that most of the reflex actions often
have conscious sensations preceding and accompanying
them, but these are said not to be essential to the performance
of the actions, because they may be absent and
the actions still take place. It is notorious that we
breathe, wink, swallow, etc., whether we are conscious of
these actions or not. Our conclusion therefore is that
these peculiar states of Consciousness are <i>accessory</i>, not
essential to the performance of these actions. The fact is
patent, the conclusion irresistible. But now consider the
equivoque: because an action takes place without our
being conscious of it, the action is said to have had no
sensation determining it. This, which is a truism when
we limit Consciousness to one of the special modes Of
Sensibility, or limit sensation to this limited Consciousness,
is a falsism when we accept Consciousness as the
total of all combined sensibilities, or Sensation as the
reaction of the sensory mechanism. That a reflex action
is determined by the sensory mechanism, no one disputes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
whether the reaction of a sensory mechanism shall be
called a sensation or not, is a question of terms. I have
shown why it must be so called if anything like coherence
is to be preserved in physiological investigations; and I
have more than once suggested that the fact of intellectual
processes taking place at times with no more consciousness
than reflex actions, is itself sufficient to show that a
process does not lapse from the mental to the mechanical
sphere simply by passing unconsciously.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as an organism is a complex of organs, its
total function must be a complex of particular functions,
each of which may analytically be treated apart. Vitality
is the total of all its physiological functions, and Consciousness
the total of all its psychological functions.
But inasmuch as it is only in its relation to the whole
that each part has functional significance, and cannot
therefore be isolated in reality, as it is in theory—cannot
live by itself, act by itself, independently of the organism
of which it is an organ, there is strict accuracy in
saying that no particular sensation can exist without involving
Consciousness; for this is only saying that no
sensory organ can react without at the same time involving
a reaction of the general sensorium. But since this
general sensorium is simultaneously affected by various
excitations each of which is a force, every sensation,
perception, emotion, or volition is a <i>resultant</i> of the composition
of these forces; and as there can be only one
resultant at a time, to be replaced by another in swift
succession, this one represents the <i>state</i> of Consciousness,
and this state may or may not be felt under the peculiar
<i>mode</i> named “Consciousness,” in its special meaning. In
other words, the reaction of a sensory organ is always sentient,
but not always consentient.</p>

<p>2. Let us illustrate this by the sensation of musical
tone. When we hear a tone we are affected not only by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
the fundamental tone, representing the vibrations of the
sounding body as a whole, but also by the harmonics or
overtones, representing the vibrations of the several parts
of that whole. It is these latter vibrations which give
the tone its timbre, or peculiar <i>quality</i>; and as the harmonics
are variable with the variable structure of the
vibrating parts, two bodies which have the same fundamental
tone may have markedly different qualities.
There are some tones which are almost entirely free from
harmonics; that is to say, their harmonics are too faint
for our ear to appreciate them, though we know that the
vibrations must be present. Apply this to the excitations
of the sensorium. Each excitation will have its fundamental
feeling, and more or less accompanying thrills of
other feelings: it is these thrills which are the harmonics,
giving to each excitation its specific quality; but they
may be so faint that no specific quality is discriminated.
A fly settles on your hand while you are writing, the faint
thrill which accompanies this excitation of your sensory
nerve gives the specific sensation of tickling, and this
causes you to move your hand with a jerk. If your attention
is preoccupied, you are said to be unconscious of the
sensation, and the jerk of your hand is called a reflex
action; but if your attention is not preoccupied, or if the
thrill is vivid, you are said to be conscious of the sensation,
and the action is no longer reflex, but volitional.
Obviously here the difference depends not on the sentient
excitation by an impression on the nerve, but on the state
of the general sensorium and its consequent reaction.
Had not the impression been carried to the sensorium, no
movement would have followed the fly’s alighting on your
hand, because no sensation (sensory reaction) would have
been excited; the hypothesis of a purely mechanical reflex
is quite inadmissible.</p>

<p>3. Or take another case. It sometimes happens that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
we fall asleep while some one is reading to us aloud. The
sounds of the reader’s voice at first awaken the familiar
thrills which give the tones their quality, and the words
their significance; but gradually as sleep steals over us,
the organism ceases to react thus; the words lose more
and more of their significance, the tones lose more and
more of their harmonics; at last we pass into the state
of unconsciousness—we cease to hear what is read. But
do we cease to feel? We have not <i>heard</i>, but we have
been <i>affected</i> by the sounds. Not by distinguishable sensations;
nevertheless a state of the general Sensibility
has been induced. To prove that we have been affected
is easy. Let the reader suddenly cease, and if our sleep
be not too profound, we at once awake. Now, unless the
sound of his voice had affected us, it is clear that the cessation
of that could not have affected us. Or let us suppose
our sleep to be unbroken by the cessation of the
sound; even this will not prove that we have been unaffected
by the sounds, it will merely prove that those
sounds, or their cessation, did not excite a conscious state.
For let the reader, in no louder tone, ask, “Are you
asleep?” and we start up, with round eyes, declaring,
“Not at all.” Nay, should even this question fail to
awaken us, the speaker need only utter some phrase likely
to excite a thrill—such as, “There’s the postman!” or,
“I smell fire!” and we start up.</p>

<p>I remember once trying the experiment on a wearied
waiter, who had fallen asleep in one of the unoccupied
boxes of a tavern. His arm rested on the table, and his
head rested on his arm: he snored the snore of the weary,
in spite of the noisy laughter and talk of the guests. I
called out “Johnson,” in a loud tone. It never moved
him. I then called “Wilson,” but he snored on. No
sooner did I call “waiter,” than he raised his head with a
sleepy “<i>yessir</i>.” Now, to suppose, in this case, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
had <i>no</i> sensation when the words “Johnson” and “Wilson”
reached his ears, but had a sensation when the word
“waiter” reached his ears, is to suppose that two similar
causes will not produce a similar effect. The dissyllable
“Johnson” would excite as potent a reaction of his sensory
organ as the dissyllable “waiter”; but the thrills—the
reflex feelings—were different, because the word
“Johnson” was not associated in his mind with any definite
actions, whereas the word “waiter” was so associated
as to become an automatic impulse.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>4. Two sisters are asleep in the same bed, and a child
cries in the next room. The sounds of these cries will
give a similar stimulus to the auditory nerve of each sister,
and excite a similar sensory reaction in each. Nevertheless,
the one sister sleeps on undisturbed, and is said
not to hear the cry. The other springs out of bed, and
attends to the child, because she being accustomed to
attend on the child and soothe it when crying, the primary
sensation has excited secondary sensations, thrills
which lead to accustomed actions. Could we look into
the mind of the sleeping sister, we should doubtless find
that the sensation excited by the child’s cry had merged
itself in the general stream, and perhaps modified her
dreams. Let her become a mother, or take on the tender
duties of a mother, and her vigilance will equal that of
her sister; because the cry will <i>then</i> excite a definite
reflex feeling, and a definite course of action. But this
very sister, who is so sensitive to the cry of a child, will
be undisturbed by a much louder noise; a dog may bark,
or a heavy wagon thunder along the street, without causing
her to turn in bed.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Although during sleep the nervous centres have by
no means their full activity, they are always capable
of responding to a stimulus, and sensation will always be
produced. When the servant taps at your bedroom door
in the morning, you are said not to hear the tap, if asleep;
you do not perceive it; but the sound reaches and rouses
you nevertheless, since when the second tap comes, although
no louder, you distinctly recognize it. In etherized
patients, sensation is constantly observed returning
before any consciousness of what is going on returns. “I
was called,” says Mr. Potter, “to give chloroform to a lady
for the extraction of ten teeth. The first five were extracted
without the slightest movement, but as the operation
proceeded, sensation returned, and I was obliged to
use considerable force to keep her in the chair during the
extraction of the last tooth. She came to herself very
shortly after, and was delighted to find she had got over
all her troubles without having felt it the least in the
world.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>5. We do not see the stars at noonday, yet they shine.
We do not see the sunbeams playing among the leaves on
a cloudy day, yet it is by these beams that the leaves and
all other objects are visible. There is a general illumination
from the sun and stars, but of this we are seldom
aware, because our attention falls upon the illumined
objects, brighter or darker than this general tone. There
is a sort of analogy to this in the general Consciousness,
which is composed of the sum of sensations excited by
the incessant simultaneous action of internal and external
stimuli. This forms, as it were, the daylight of our existence.
We do not habitually attend to it, because attention
falls on those particular sensations of pleasure or of pain,
of greater or of less intensity, which usurp a prominence
among the objects of the sensitive panorama. But just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
as we need the daylight to see the brilliant and the sombre
forms of things, we need this living Consciousness to feel
the pleasures and the pains of life. It is therefore as
erroneous to imagine that we have no other sensations
than those which we distinctly recognize—as to imagine
that we see no other light than what is reflected from the
shops and equipages, the colors and splendors which arrest
the eye.</p>

<p>The amount of light received from the stars may be
small, but it is present. The greater glory of the sunlight
may render this starlight inappreciable, but it does
not render it inoperative. In like manner the amount of
sensation received from some of the centres may be inappreciable
in the presence of more massive influences
from other centres; but though inappreciable it cannot be
inoperative—it must form an integer in the sum.</p>

<p>6. The reader’s daily experience will assure him that
over and above all the particular sensations capable of
being separately recognized, there is a general stream
of Sensation which constitutes his feeling of existence—the
Consciousness of himself as a sensitive being. The
ebullient energy which one day exalts life, and the mournful
depression which the next day renders life a burden
almost intolerable, are feelings not referable to any of the
particular sensations, but arise from the massive yet obscure
sensibilities of the viscera, which form so important
a part of the general stream of Sensation. Some of these
may emerge into distinct recognition. We may feel the
heart beat, the intestines move, the glands secrete; anything
<i>unusual</i> in their action will force itself on our
attention.</p>

<p>“What we have been long used to,” says Whytt, “we
become scarcely sensible of; while things which are new,
though much more trifling, and of weaker impression,
affect us remarkably. Thus he who is wont to spend his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
time in the country is surprisingly affected, upon first
coming into a populous city, with the noise and bustle
which prevail there: of this, however, he becomes daily
less sensible, till at length he regards it no more than they
who have been used to it all their lifetime. The same
seems to be the case also with what passes within our
bodies. Few persons in health feel the beating of their
heart, though it strikes against their ribs with considerable
force every second; whereas the motion of a fly upon one’s
face or hands occasions a very sensible and uneasy titillation.
The pulsation of the great <i>aorta</i> itself is wholly
unobserved by us; yet the unusual beating of a small
artery in any of the fingers becomes very remarkable.”</p>

<p>7. A large amount of sensation is derived from the
muscular sense, yet we are not aware of the nice adjustments
of the muscles, regulated by this sensibility, when
we sit or walk. No sooner are we placed in an exceptional
position, as in walking on a narrow ledge, than we become
distinctly aware of the effort required to preserve equilibrium.
It is not the novelty of the position which has
increased our sensibility; that has only caused us to
attend to our sensations. In like manner, the various
streams of sensation which make up our general sense of
existence, separately escape notice until one of them
becomes obstructed, or increases in impetuosity. When
we are seated at a window, and look out at the trees and
sky, we are so occupied with the aspects and the voices
of external Nature, that no attention whatever is given to
the fact of our own existence; yet all this while there
has been a massive and diffusive feeling arising from the
organic processes; and of this we become distinctly aware
if we close our eyes, shut off all sounds, and abstract the
sensations of touch and temperature—it is then perceived
as a vast and powerful stream of sensation, belonging to
none of the special Senses, but to the System as a whole.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
It is on this general stream that depend those well-known
but indescribable states named “feeling well” and “feeling
ill”—the <i>bien être</i> and <i>malaise</i> of every day. Of two
men looking from the same window, on the same landscape,
one will be moved to unutterable sadness, yearning
for the peace of death; the other will feel his soul suffused
with serenity and content: the one has a gloomy
background, into which the sensations excited by the
landscape are merged; the other has a happy background,
on which the sensations play like ripples on a sunny lake.
The tone of each man’s feeling is determined by the state
of his general consciousness. Except in matters of pure
demonstration, we are all determined towards certain
conclusions as much by this general consciousness as by
logic. Our philosophy, when not borrowed, is little more
than the expression of our personality.</p>

<p>8. Having thus explained the relation of particular
sensations to the general state of Consciousness considered
as the function of the whole organism, we may
henceforward speak of particular sentient states, as we
speak of particular organs and functions, all the while
presupposing that the organs and functions necessarily
involve the organism, since <i>apart</i> from the organism they
have no such significance. The reaction of a sensory
organ is therefore always a sentient phenomenon. Apart
from the living organism there can be no such vital reaction,
but only a physical reaction. It is commonly
supposed that sensation is simply the molecular excitation
of the cerebrum; yet no one will maintain that if the
cerebrum of a corpse be excited, by a galvanic current
sent through the optic nerve, for instance, this excitation
will be a sensation. Whence we may conclude that it
is not the physical reaction or stimulus which constitutes
sensation, but the physiological reaction of the living
organism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
9. Now this is the point which the advocates of the
Reflex Theory, implicitly or explicitly, always deny. Let
us trace the origin of the fallacy, if possible. When we
remove the eye from a recently killed animal, and let
a beam of light fall on it, the pupil contracts. This is a
purely mechanical action; no one would suggest that
a sensation determined it. When we remove the leg, and
irritate its nerve, the leg is jerked out. This is also a
purely mechanical action. When we remove the brain
from an animal, and pinch its toes, the leg is withdrawn
or the pincers are pushed aside. Is this equally a purely
mechanical action? And if not, why not?</p>

<p>The Reflex Theory would have us believe that all three
cases were mechanical, at least in so far as they were all
destitute of sentient co-operation, the ground for this
conclusion being the hypothesis that the brain is the exclusive
seat of sensation. The Reflex Theory further concludes
that since these, and analogous actions, are performed
when the brain is removed, they, being thus
independent of sentience, may be performed when the
brain is present without any co-operation of sentience.
The grounds for this conclusion being the facts that in
the normal state of the organism there are many actions
of which we are sometimes conscious, and at other times
unconscious; and some actions—such as the dilatation
and contraction of the pupil—of which we are never
conscious. This observation of parts detached from the
organism seems confirmed by observation of actions passing
in our own organisms, both converging to the conclusion
that the actions in question are purely mechanical,
involving no sentience whatever. We are taught, therefore,
that there is besides the sentient mechanism, to
which all conscious actions are referred, a reflex mechanism,
to which all unconscious actions are referred. The
cerebro-spinal axis, acting as a whole, constitutes the first;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
the spinal axis, acting without the co-operation of the
cerebrum, constitutes the second.</p>

<p>10. Before proceeding with our exposition of the theory
it may be well to state two considerations which must
be constantly in view. If it should appear that there is
any reasonable evidence for refusing to limit Sensibility
to the cerebrum—and this evidence I shall adduce—the
Reflex Theory must obviously be remodelled. Nor
is this all. We might see overwhelming evidence in
favor of the hypothesis that the cerebrum is the exclusive
seat of Sensibility, and still reject as a fallacy the conclusion
that because certain actions can be performed in
the absence of the cerebrum, therefore those actions in
the normal organism are likewise performed without cerebral
co-operation. I mean that it is a fallacy to conclude
from the contractions of the pupil, and the jerking of the
leg, when eye and leg are detached from the organism,
that therefore when eye and leg form integral parts of
the organism, such contractions and jerkings are mechanical
reflexes without sentient conditions. And the fallacy
is analogous to that which would conclude from the observations
of a mechanical automaton, that similar appearances
in a vital organism were equally automatic and
mechanical. So long as both sets of phenomena are
apprehended simply as they appear to the sense of sight,
they may be indistinguishable; but no sooner do we
apprehend them through other modes, and examine the
<i>modes of production</i> of the phenomena, than we come
upon cardinal differences. A limb detached from the
organism is like a phrase detached from a sentence: it
has lost its vital significance, its functional value, in losing
its connection with the other parts. The whole sentence
is necessary for the slightest meaning of its constituent
words, and each word is a language-element only
when ideally or verbally connected with the other words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
required to form a sentence; without subject, predicate,
and copula, no sentence can be formed. So the organic
connexus of parts with a living whole is necessary for
the simplest function of each organ; and a limb, or any
other part, is a physiological element only when (ideally
or really) an integral of a vital whole. The organism
may be truncated by the removal of certain parts, as the
sentence may be abbreviated by the removal of certain
phrases; but so long as subject, predicate, and copula
remain, there is a meaning in the sentence; and so long
as the organic connexus needful for vitality remains,
there will be vital function. The eye detached from the
organism is no longer a part of the living whole, it no
longer lives, its phenomena cease to be vital, its movements
cease to have sentient conditions. The movements
of the pupil may seem to be the same as those of
the living eye; but when we come to examine their
modes of production, we learn that they are not the same.
The stimulus of light falling on the eye in the two cases
necessarily has a different effect, because the effect is the
result of the co-operating causes, and the co-operation in
the one case is that of a lifeless organ, in the other that
of a living organism. So long as the eye forms an integral
part of the organism, every stimulus acting on the
eye necessarily acts on the organism, and every reaction
of the organ is necessarily conditioned by the state of
the organism. Further, every stimulation of a sensory
nerve necessarily affects the general sensorium, since the
whole nervous system is structurally continuous and functionally
co-operant. (See Prob. II. § <a href="#II_16">16</a>.) Therefore, the
stimulation of the eye, although too faint to be discriminated
as a conscious sensation, must enter as a sentient
tremor into the general stream of Sentience; and although
we have no test delicate enough to reveal this operation,
we know the <i>obverse</i> operation of conscious sensation on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
the movements of the pupil—in surprise, for example,
the pupil is dilated.</p>

<p>11. There are still stronger reasons for asserting that
the spinal reflexes are necessarily conditioned by the
general state of the sensorium, so that in the normal
organism we cannot legitimately exclude them from Sentience;
and the Reflex Theory is therefore unphysiological,
even on the hypothesis that the cerebrum is the
exclusive seat of Sensibility. This hypothesis, however,
seems to me untenable; and all the observed facts which
it is invented to explain admit of a far more consistent
explanation. It is irrational to suppose that a limb, detached
from the body, <i>felt</i> the stimulus which caused its
muscles to contract. The limb is not a living organism,
having a sentient mechanism in its nervous mechanism.
Not less irrational is it to suppose that when the limb
forms an integral part of a living organism, with a sentient
mechanism of nerves and nerve-centres, this organism
does not react on the stimulus which excites the muscles
of the limb to contract; nor, pursuing the same train of
reasoning, is it irrational to suppose that when this living
organism has been mutilated, and certain parts destroyed,
which do not in their destruction prevent the
connexus of the rest, but leave intact a sentient mechanism
of nerves and nerve-centres, then also this truncated
organism still reacts as a whole, still feels the stimulus
which causes the muscles of the limb to contract. Hypothesis
for hypothesis, we may at least say that the one
is as reasonable as the other. And I shall be disappointed
if, when the reader has gone through all the evidence
hereafter to be adduced, he does not conclude that
the hypothesis which assigns Sensibility to the nervous
mechanism as a whole is not the more acceptable of the
two.</p>

<p>12. Let us now pursue our exposition of the Reflex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
Theory. All that we have endeavoured to establish respecting the
essential identity of the processes in conscious and unconscious
states, and voluntary and involuntary actions,—an
identity which does not exclude differences of degree corresponding
with these different terms,—is ignored or denied in
the Reflex Theory. Whereas I suppose all processes to be
reflex processes, some of them having the voluntary, others
the involuntary character, physiologists generally distinguish
the involuntary as reflex, and invent for this class a
special mechanism. According to Marshall Hall, who originated
the modern form of this theory, actions are divisible into
four distinct classes: the <i>voluntary</i>, dependent on the brain;
the <i>involuntary</i>, dependent on the irritability of the muscular
fibre; the <i>respiratory</i>, wherein “the motive influence passes
in a <i>direct line</i> from one point of the nervous system to certain
muscles”; and the <i>reflex</i>, dependent on the “true spinal
system” of <i>incident-excitor</i> nerves, and of <i>reflex-motor</i> nerves.
These last-named actions are produced when an <i>impression</i>
on the sensitive surface is conveyed, by an excitor-nerve, to
the spinal cord, and is there <i>reflected</i> back on the muscles
by a corresponding motor-nerve. In this process <i>no</i> sensation
whatever occurs. The action is purely reflex, purely
<i>excito-motor</i>—like the action of an ordinary mechanism.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>Müller, who shares with Marshall Hall the glory of having
established this classification, thinks that although the
absence of sensation is a characteristic of the reflex actions,
these actions may be, and are at times, accompanied by sensation.
“The view I take of the matter is the following:
Irritation of sensitive fibres of a spinal nerve excites primarily
a centripetal action of the nervous principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
conveying the impression to the spinal cord; if the
centripetal action can then be continued to the <i>sensorium
commune</i>, a true sensation is the result; if, on account of
division of the cord, it cannot be communicated to the
sensorium, it still exerts its whole influence upon the
cord; in both cases a reflex motor action may be the
result.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>13. It is needless nowadays to point out that the existence
of a distinct system of excito-motor nerves belongs
to Imaginary Anatomy; but it is not needless to point
out that the Imaginary Physiology founded on it still survives.
The hypothetical process seems to me not less at
variance with observation and induction, than the hypothetical
structure invented for its basis. We have already
seen that what Anatomy positively teaches is totally unlike
the reflex mechanism popularly imagined. The sensory
nerve is not seen to enter the spinal cord at one
point, and pass over to a corresponding point of exit; it
is seen to enter the gray substance, which is continuous
throughout the spinal cord; it is there lost to view, its
course being untraceable. Nor does the physiological
process present the aspect demanded by the theory: it is
not that of a direct and uniform reflexion, such as would
result from an impression on one spot transmitted across
the spinal cord to a corresponding motor-nerve. The
impression is sometimes followed by one movement, sometimes
by another very different movement, each determined
by the state of neural tension in the whole central
system.</p>

<p>Even the facts on which the Reflex Theory is based are
differently interpreted by different physiologists. Van
Deen, for instance, considers that Reflexion takes place
without Volition, but not without Sensation; and Budge,
that it takes place without perception (<i>Vorstellung</i>). And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
when it is remembered that most of the reflex actions will
be accompanied by distinct consciousness whenever attention
is directed to them, or the vividness of the stimulation
is slightly increased, it becomes evident that the
absence of Consciousness (discrimination) is not the differentia
of Reflex action.</p>

<p>14. Nor can the absence of spontaneity be accepted as
a differentia. <i>All</i> actions are excited by stimulation,
internal or external. What are called the spontaneous
actions are simply those which are prompted by internal,
or by not recognizable stimuli; and could we see the process,
we should see a neural change initiated by some
stimulation, whether the change was conscious and volitional,
or unconscious and automatic. The dog rising
from sleep and restlessly moving about, is acting spontaneously,
whether the stimulation which awakens him be
a sensation of hunger, a sensation of sound, the sharp pain
of a prick, or a dash of cold water. If he wags his tail at
the sight of his master, or wags it when dreaming, the
stimulation is said to be spontaneous; but if after his
spinal cord has been divided the tail wags when his abdomen
is tickled, the action is called reflex. In all three
cases there has been a process of excitation and reflexion.</p>

<p>15. The advocates of the Reflex Theory insist that
spontaneity is always absent in brainless animals; whence
the conclusion that the brain is the exclusive organ of
sensation. But the fact asserted is contradicted by the
evidence. No experimenter can have failed to observe
numberless examples of spontaneity in brainless animals.
Many examples have already been incidentally noticed in
previous pages. Let me add one more from my notes:
I decapitated a toad and a triton, and divided the spinal
cord of another triton and a frog. At first the movements
of the decapitated animals were insignificant; but on the
second day the headless toad was quite as lively as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
frog; and the headless triton little less so than his companion
with cord divided but brain intact. I have, at the
time of writing this, a frog whose cord was divided some
weeks ago. He remains almost motionless unless when
touched; he is generally found in the same spot, and in
the same attitude to-day as yesterday, unless touched, or
unless the table be shaken. He occasionally moves one
of the forelegs; occasionally one of the hind-legs; but
without changing his position. If he were brainless, this
quiescence would be cited in proof of the absence of spontaneity
in the absence of the brain; but this conclusion
would be fallacious, and is seen to be so in the spontaneous
movements of his companion who has <i>no</i> brain.</p>

<p>16. With spontaneity is associated the idea of volition,
and with volition <i>choice</i>. Now I admit that it is complicating
the question to ask any one to conceive a headless
animal choosing one action rather than another; but
it is equally difficult to reconcile ourselves to the idea of
“choice” in contemplating the actions of a mollusc. In
what sense we can speak of the volition of a mollusc or an
insect has already been considered (p. 408). When a man
in a fit of coughing seizes a glass of water to allay the
tickling in his throat, we have no hesitation in declaring
this to be volitional—and the remedy to be <i>chosen</i>. But
when a brainless animal adopts some <i>unusual</i> means, after
the failure of the usual means, to allay an irritation, we
still hesitate to call the action volitional. I see, however,
no objection to calling it the adaptation of a sensitive
mechanism which is markedly unlike any inorganic mechanism.</p>

<p>Place a child of two or three years old upon his back,
and tickle his right cheek with a feather. He will probably
move his head away. Continue tickling, and he will
rub the spot with his right hand, <i>never</i> using the left hand
for the right cheek, so long as the right hand is free; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
if you hold his right hand, he will use the left. Does any
one dispute the voluntary character of these actions?</p>

<p>Now compare the actions of the sleeping child under
similar circumstances, and their sequence will be precisely
similar. This contrast is the more illustrative,
because physiologists generally assume that in sleep consciousness
and volition are <i>suspended</i>. They say: “The
brain sleeps, the spinal cord never; volition and sensation
may be suspended, but not reflex action.” This proposition
is extremely questionable; yet it is indispensable to
the reflex theory; because unless sensation and volition
<i>are</i> suspended during sleep, we must admit that they can
act, without at the same time calling into activity that
degree of sensibility which is supposed to constitute consciousness.
The child moves in his sleep, defends himself
in his sleep; but he is not “aware” of it.</p>

<p>“Children,” says Pflüger, “sleep more soundly than
adults, and seem to be more sensitive in sleep. I tickled
the right nostril of a three-year-old boy. He at once
raised his right hand to push me away, and then rubbed
the place. When I tickled the left nostril he raised the
left hand. I then softly drew both arms down, and laid
them close to the body, embedding the left arm in the
clothes, and placing on it a pillow, by gentle pressure on
which I could keep the arm down without awakening
him. Having done this I tickled his left nostril. He at
once began to move the imprisoned arm, but could not
reach his face with it, because I held it firmly though
gently down. He now drew his head aside, and I continued
tickling, whereupon he raised the <i>right</i> hand, and
with it rubbed the <i>left</i> nostril—an action he never performed
when the left hand was free.”</p>

<p>17. This simple but ingenious experiment establishes
one important point, namely, that the so-called reflex
actions observed in sleep are determined by sensation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
volition. The sleeping child behaves exactly as the
waking child behaved; the only difference being in the
energy and rapidity of the actions. If the waking child
felt and willed, surely the sleeping child, when it performed
precisely similar actions, cannot be said to have
felt nothing, willed nothing? It is not at one moment a
sentient organism, and at the next an insentient mechanism.</p>

<p>It is possible to meet this case by assuming that the
child was nearly awake, and that a dim consciousness was
aroused by the tickling, so that the cerebral activity
was in fact awakened. But, plausible as this explanation
may be (and I am the more ready to admit it because I
believe the brain always co-operates when it is present),
it altogether fails when we come to experiments on decapitated
animals. If any one will institute a series of
such experiments, taking care to compare the actions
of the animal before and after decapitation, he will perceive
that there is no more difference between them than
between those of the sleeping and the waking child.</p>

<p>18. Even more striking is the following experiment,
devised by Pflüger, which I have verified, and varied,
many times: A frog is decapitated, or its brain is removed.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
When it has recovered from the effect of the
ether, and manifests lively sensibility, we place it on its
back, and touch, with acetic acid, the skin of its thigh
just above the <i>condylus internus femoris</i>. (Let the reader
imagine his own shoulder burnt at the point where it can
be reached with the thumb of the same arm, and he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
realize the operation.) No sooner does the acid begin to
burn than the frog stretches out the <i>other</i> leg, so that its
body is somewhat drawn towards it. The leg that has
been burnt is now bent, and the back of the foot is applied
to the spot, rubbing the acid away—just as your
thumb might rub your shoulder. This is very like the
action of the tickled child, who always uses the right
hand to rub the right cheek, unless it be held; but when
the child’s right hand is prevented from rubbing, the left
will be employed; and precisely this do we observe with
the brainless frog: prevent it from using its right leg, and
it will use its left!</p>

<p>This has been proved by decapitating another frog, and
cutting off the foot of the leg which is to be irritated.
No sooner is the acid applied, than the leg is bent as before,
and the stump is moved to and fro, as if to rub away
the acid. But the acid is not rubbed away, and the animal
becomes restless, as if trying to hit upon some other
plan for freeing himself of the irritation. And it is
worthy of remark that he often hits upon plans very
similar to those which an intelligent human being adopts
under similar circumstances. Thus, the irritation continuing,
he will sometimes cease the vain efforts with
his stump, and stretching that leg straight out, bends the
<i>other</i> leg over towards the irritated spot, and rubs the
acid away. But, to show how far this action is from one
of “mere mechanism,” how far it is from being a direct
reflex of an impression on a group of muscles, the frog
does not <i>always</i> hit even on this plan. Sometimes it
bends its irritated leg more energetically, and likewise
bends the body towards it, so as to permit the spot to be
rubbed against the flank—just as the child, when both
his hands are held, will bend his cheek towards his
shoulder and rub it there.</p>

<p>19. It is difficult to resist such evidence as is here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
manifested. The brainless frog “chooses” a new plan
when the old one fails, just as the waking child chooses.
And an illustration of how sensations guide and determine
movements, may be seen in another observation of
the brainless frog, when, as often happens, it does not hit
upon either of the plans just mentioned, but remains
apparently restless and helpless; if under these circumstances
we perform a part of the action for it, <i>it will complete
what we have begun</i>: if we rub the irritated leg, at
some distance from the spot where the acid is, with the
foot of the other, the frog suddenly avails itself of this
<i>guiding sensation</i>, and at once directs its foot to the irritated
spot.</p>

<p>In these experiments on the triton and the frog, the
evidence of sensation and volition is all the stronger, because
the reactions produced by irritations are not uniform.
If when a decapitated animal were stimulated it
always reacted in <i>precisely the same way</i>, and never chose
<i>new means</i> on the failure of the old, it would be conceivable
to attribute the results to simple reflex action—i. e.
the mechanical transference of an impulse along a prescribed
path. It is possible so to conceive the breathing,
or the swallowing mechanism: the impression may be
directly reflected on certain groups of muscles. But I
cannot conceive a machine suddenly striking out new
methods, when the old methods fail. I cannot conceive
a machine thrown into disorder when its accustomed
actions fail, and in this disorder suddenly lighting upon
an action likely to succeed, and continuing <i>that</i>; but I
can conceive this to be done by an organism, for my own
experience and observation of animals assures me that
this is always the way new lines of action are adopted.
And this which is observed of the unmutilated animal, I
have just shown to be observed of the brainless animal;
wherefore the conclusion is, that if ever the frog is sentient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
if ever its actions are guided by sensation, they are
so when its brain is removed.</p>

<p>20. Schröder van der Kolk thinks that Pflüger was
deceived in attributing sensation and volition to the frog,
because the reflex actions are, he says, so nicely adapted
to their ends, that they are undistinguishable from voluntary
actions. The mechanism is such that, by means of
the communications established between various groups
of cells, all these actions adapted to an end may be excited
by every stimulus. But I deny the fact. I deny
that all the actions are awakened by every stimulus.
Only some few are awakened, and those are not always
the same, nor do they follow the same order of succession.
One decapitated frog does not behave exactly like another
under similar circumstances; does not behave exactly
like himself at different seasons; unlike a machine, he
manifests spontaneity in his actions, and volition in the
direction of his actions.</p>

<p>21. The reader will notice that my illustrations show
these actions of the brainless animal to have the same
external characters as those of the unmutilated animals.
I am therefore not here concerned to prove the psychical
nature of these actions, unless it be granted that the unmutilated
animal has sensation and volition. This of
course can only be inferred, not proved. But the inference
must not be allowed in the one case and refused in
the other. Young rabbits and puppies when taken from
their mothers manifest discomfort by restless movement
and whining. Do they feel the discomfort they thus express?
If ever rabbits and puppies may be said to feel,
we must answer, Yes. Well, if the brain be removed
from rabbits and puppies, precisely similar phenomena
are observed when these young animals are taken from
their mothers. “I observed the motions, which seemed
the result of discomfort, quickly cease when I warmed
the young rabbit by breathing on it. After a while it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
was completely at rest, and seemed sunk in deep sleep;
occasionally, however, it moved one of its legs without
any external stimulus having been applied, and this not
spasmodically, but in the manner of a sleeping animal.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>
Is this cessation of the restlessness, when warmth is restored,
not evidence of sensation? We see an infant restless,
struggling, and squalling; and we believe that it is
hungry, or that some other sensations agitate it; it is put
to the breast, and its squalls subside; or a finger is placed
in its mouth, and it sucks that, in a peaceful lull, for a
few moments, to recommence squalling when the finger
yields no satisfaction. If we accept these as signs of sensation,
I do not see how we can deny such sensation to
the brainless animal which will also cease to cry, and will
suck the delusive finger.</p>

<p>22. One of the earliest advocates of the Reflex Theory
sums up his observations in these words: “It is clear
that brainless animals, although without sensation, because
not endowed with mind, nevertheless, by means of
external impressions which operate incessantly on them,
perform all the acts and manifest all the activity of the
sentient animal; everything that is effected sensationally
and volitionally, they effect by means of the organic
forces of the impressions.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Call Sensibility one of the
organic forces, if you please, but so long as the acts performed
are not only the same as those of a sentient animal,
but are performed by the same mechanism, they
have every claim to the character of sensational acts
which can be urged in the case of these animals when
the brain is present. And the only reason on which this
claim is disputed is the assumed loss of all sensation with
the loss of the brain. Here, therefore, lies the central
point to be determined.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEDUCTIONS FROM GENERAL LAWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>23. <span class="firstword">The</span> evidence is of two kinds: deductions from the
general laws of nervous action, and inductions from particular
manifestations. The former furnish a presumption,
the latter a proof.</p>

<p>The central process which initiates a reflex action may
be excited by the external stimulation of a peripheral
nerve, by the internal stimulation of a peripheral nerve,
or by the irradiation from some other part of the central
tissue. The last-named stimulations are the least intelligible,
because they are so varied and complex, and so
remote from observation; among them may be placed, 1°,
the organized impulses of Instinct and Habit, with their
fixed modes of manifestation; 2°, the organized impulses
of Emotion, which are more variable in their manifestations,
because more fluctuating in their conditions; 3°, the
organized impulses of Intellect, the most variable of all.
Whether we shrink on the contact of a cold substance or
on hearing a sudden sound,—at the sight of a terrible
object,—at the imaginary vision of the object,—or because
we feign the terror which is thus expressed,—the
reflex mechanism of shrinking is in each case the same,
and the neural process discharged on the muscles is the
same; but the state of Feeling which originated the
change—or, in strictly physiological terms, the inciting
neural process which preceded this reflex neural process—was
in each case somewhat different, yet in each case was
a mode of Sensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
24. The property of Sensibility belongs to the whole
central tissue; and we have every reason to believe that
unless it is excited no reflex takes place, whereas when it
is exaggerated—as in epilepsy, or under strychnine—the
reflex discharges are convulsive. When anæsthetics
are given, consciousness first disappears, and then reflexion.
When the sensorium is powerfully excited by
<i>other</i> stimuli, the normal stimulus fails to excite either
consciousness or reflexion. Hence our conclusion is that
for consciousness, on the one hand, and <i>normal</i> reflexion,
on the other, the proximate condition is a change in the
sensorium; or—to phrase it more familiarly—Feeling
is necessary for reflex action.</p>

<p>The difficulty in apprehending this lies in the ambiguity
of the term Feeling. Many readers who would
find no difficulty in admitting Sensibility as a necessary
element in reflex action, will resist the idea of identifying
Sensibility with Feeling. But this repugnance must be
overcome if we are to understand the various modes of
Sensibility which represent Feeling in animals, and its
varieties in ourselves. We understand how the general
Sensibility manifests itself in markedly different sensations—how
that of the optic centre differs from that of
the auditory centre, and both from a spinal centre. The
tones of a violin are not the same as the tones of a violoncello,
both differ from the tones of a key-bugle: yet
they all come under the same general laws of tonality.
So, as I often insist, the tissues in brain and cord being
the same, their properties must be the same, their laws
of excitation, irradiation, and combination the same,
through all the varieties in their manifestations due to
varieties of innervation. Hence it is that there are reflex
cerebral processes no less than reflex spinal processes:
the motor impulse from, the hemispheres on the <i>corpora
striata</i>, or from posterior gray substance on anterior gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
substance, is similar to that from the anterior gray substance
on the motor nerves. The difference in reflexes
arises from the terminal organs; as the difference in sensations
arises from the surfaces stimulated. But not only
are there reflex processes in the brain, of the same <i>order</i>
as those in the cord, there are volitional processes in the
cord of the same order as those in the brain. And in
both the processes are sometimes conscious, sometimes
unconscious. No evidence suggests that in the conscious
action there is a sensorial process, and a purely physical
process in the unconscious action—only a different <i>relation</i>
of one sensorial process to others.</p>

<p>25. Let us contrast a cerebral and a spinal process, in
respect to the three stages of stimulation, irradiation, and
discharge. A luminous impression stimulates my retina,
this excites my sensorium, in which second stage I am
conscious of the luminous sensation; the final discharge
is a perception, or a mental articulation of the <i>name</i> of
the luminous object. But the irradiation may perhaps
not have been such as to cause a <i>conscious</i> sensation, because
the requisite neural elements were already grouped
in some other way; in this case there is an unconscious
discharge on some motor group, and instead of perceiving
and naming the luminous object, I move my head, or my
band, or my whole body, avoiding the object, or grasping
at it. A third issue is possible: the irradiation, instead
of exciting a definite perception, or a definite movement,
may be merged in the stream of simultaneous excitations,
and thus form the component of a group, and the discharge
of this group will be a perception or a movement.</p>

<p>It is the same with a spinal process. An impression
on the skin is irradiated in the cord, and the response is
a movement, of which we are conscious, or unconscious.
Here also a third issue is possible: the irradiation may
be merged in a stream of simultaneous excitations, modifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
them and modified by them, thus forming a component
in some ulterior discharge.</p>

<p>26. The obstacle in the way of recognizing that cerebral
processes and spinal processes are of the same order
of sensorial phenomena, and have the same physiological
significance when considered irrespective of the group of
organs they call into activity, is similar to the obstacle
which has prevented psychologists from recognizing the
identity of the logical process in the combinations of
Feeling and the combinations of Thought, i. e. the Logic
of Feeling and the Logic of Signs. This obstacle is the
fixing attention on the diversity of the effects when the
same process operates with different elements. Because
the spinal cord manifests the phenomena of sensation and
volition, we are not to conclude that it also manifests
ideation and imagination; any more than we are to conclude
that a mollusc is capable of musical feelings because
it is affected by sounds.</p>

<p>27. The careless confusion of general properties with
special applications of those properties, and of functions
with properties, has been a serious hindrance to the right
understanding of Sensibility and its operations. Instead
of recognizing that the nervous system has one general
mode of reaction, which remains the same under every
variety of combination with other systems, physiologists
commonly lose sight of this general property, and fix on
one mode of its manifestation as the sole characteristic of
Sensibility. Sometimes the mode fixed on is Pain, at
other times Attention. Thus, when an animal manifests
no evidence of pain under stimulations which ordinarily
excite severe pain, this is often interpreted as a proof that
<i>all</i> sensation is absent; and if with this absence of pain
there is—as there often is—clear evidence of the presence
of some other mode of sensibility, the contradiction
is evaded by the assumption that what here looks like evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
of sensation is merely mechanical reflexion. One
would think that Physiology and Pathology had been
silent on the facts of analgesia without anæsthesia, and
of so much conscious sensation which is unaccompanied
by pain.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> Who does not know that a patient will lose
one kind of sensibility while retaining others—cease to
feel pain, yet feel temperature, or be insensible to touch,
yet exquisitely alive to pain?<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Inasmuch as Sensibility
depends on the condition of the centres, an abnormal
condition will obviously transform the reaction of the
centres into one very unlike the normal reaction. For
example, Antoine Cros had a patient who was quite unable
to feel the sensation of cold on her left side—every
cold object touching her skin on that side was felt as a
very hot one; whereas a hot object produced “the sort of
sensation which followed the application of an intermittent
voltaic current.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Thus also the experiments of
Rose<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> and others have exhibited the effects of a dose of
Santonine in causing all objects to be seen as yellow in
one stage, and violet in another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
28. If, then, certain alterations in the organic conditions
are accompanied by a suppression or perversion of
some modes of Sensibility, without suppressing the rest,
it is but rational to suppose that profound disturbances
of the organic mechanism, such as must result from the
removal of the brain, will also suppress or pervert several
modes of Sensibility, and yet leave intact those modes
which belong to the intact parts of the mechanism. Assuming
that the spinal centres with the organs they
innervate are capable of reacting under certain modes
of sensation, these will not necessarily be suppressed by
removal of the brain—all that will thereby be suppressed
is their co-operation with the brain. I know it
will be said that precisely this co-operation is necessary
for sensation; and that the spinal reactions are simple
reflexions in which sensation has no part. This, however,
is the position I hope to turn. Meanwhile my assumption
is that sensation necessarily plays a part in the reflex
actions <i>of the organism</i>, and when that organism is truncated,
its actions are proportionately limited, its sensations
less complex. The spinal cord, separated from encephalic
connections, cannot react in the special forms of Sensation
known as color, scent, taste, sound, etc., because it does
not innervate the organs of these special senses, nor co-operate
with their centres. But it can, and does, react in
other modes: it innervates skin and muscles; and the
sensibilities, thus excited, it can also <i>combine</i> and <i>co-ordinate</i>.
It has its Memory, and its Logic, just as the brain
has: both no longer than they are integral parts of an
active living organism: neither when the organism is
inactive or dead. We do not expect the retina to respond
in sounds, nor the ear to respond in colors: we expect
each organ to have its special mode of reaction. What is
common to both is Sensibility. What is common to brain
and cord is Sensibility—and the laws of Grouping. Instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
of marvelling at the disappearance of so many
modes of Sensibility when the brain is removed, our surprise
should be to find so many evidences of Sensibility
remaining after so profound a mutilation of the mechanism.</p>

<p>29. The current hypothesis, which assumes that the
brain is the sole organ of the mind, the sole seat of sensation,
is a remnant of the ancient hypothesis respecting
the Soul and its seat; and on the whole I think the ancient
hypothesis is the more rational of the two. If the
Soul inhabits the organism, using it as an instrument,
playing on its organs as a musician plays on his instrument,
we are not called upon to explain the mode of operation
of this mysterious agent; but if the Soul be the
subjective side of the Life, the spiritual aspect of the material
organism, then since it is a synthesis of all the
organic forces, the consensus of all the sentient phenomena,
no one part can usurp the prerogatives of all, but all
are requisite for each. And this indeed is what few
physiologists would nowadays dispute. In spite of their
localizing sensation in the cerebral cells, they would not
maintain that the cerebral cells, nor even the whole brain,
could produce sensation—if <i>detached</i> from the organism;
the cheek of the guillotined victim may have blushed
when struck, but who believes that the brain felt the insult,
or the blow? Obviously, therefore, when we read
that thought is “a property of the gray substance of the
brain, as gravitation is of matter,” or that the brain is the
exclusive organ of Sensation, the writers cannot consistently
carry out their hypothesis unless they silently reintroduce
other organs as co-operating agents; for a neural
process in the cerebrum is <i>in itself</i> no more a sensation
than it is a muscular contraction, or a glandular secretion:
the muscles must co-operate for the contraction, the gland
for the secretion, the neural process being simply the exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
cause. In like manner the Sensorium is necessary
for the sensation, the neural process—in cerebrum, or
elsewhere—being simply the exciting cause.</p>

<p>30. And what is the Sensorium? A long chapter
would be required to state the various opinions which
have been held respecting its <i>seat</i>, although amid all the
disputes as to the organ, there has been unanimity as to
the function, which is that of converting stimulations into
sensations. I cannot pause here to examine the contending
arguments, but must content myself with expounding
the opinion I hold, namely, that the Sensorium is the
<i>whole</i> of the sensitive organism, and not any one isolated
portion of it. When light falls on the optic organ, or air
pulses on the auditory organ, the reaction of each organ
determines the <i>specific</i> character of the sensation, <i>but no
such sensation is possible unless there be a reaction of the
organism</i>; and the nature of the product will of course
vary with the varying factors which co-operate—a simple
organism, a truncated organism, an exhausted or otherwise
occupied organism, will react differently from a
complex, a normal, or an unoccupied organism. Detach
the optic organ with its centre from the rest of the organism,
and no normal sensation of Sight will result from its
stimulation; and in a lesser degree this is equally true of
a stimulation of the optic organ when the sensorium is
exhausted, or powerfully affected by other stimuli. Because
of the great importance of the cerebrum, and its
predominance in the nervous system, it has been supposed
to constitute the whole of the sensorium, in spite of the
evidence of varied Sensibility after the cerebrum has been
removed. I do not wish to understate the cerebral importance
(see p. 166), yet I must say that the modern phrase
<i>cerebration</i>, when employed as more than a shorthand expression
of the complex processes which a cerebral process
initiates, and when taken as the objective equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
of Consciousness or of Thought, seems to me not more
justifiable than to speak of Combustion as the equivalent
of Railway Transport. The railway wagons will not move
unless the fuel which supplies the boiler be ignited; the
organism will not think unless the cerebrum excites this
peculiar mode of Sensibility by its action on the organs.
<i>It is the man, and not the brain, that thinks</i>: it is the
organism as a whole, and not one organ, that feels and
acts.</p>

<p>31. Consciousness, or Sensation, is a complex product
not to be recognized in any <i>one</i> of its factors. Cerebral
processes and spinal processes are the elements we analytically
separate, as muscular contractions are the elements
of limb-movements. The synthetic unity of these elements
is a reflex; this we analytically decompose into a
sensation and a movement; and then we speak of sensation
as the reaction of the sensory organ, the movement as the
reaction of the muscular organ. By a similar procedure
we separate the stimulation of a sensory nerve from the
reaction of the sensory organ, and that from the reaction
of the sensorium; and in this way we may come to regard
Cerebration as Thought. But those who employ this artifice
should remember that the organism is not an assemblage
of organs, made up of parts put together like a
machine. The organs are differentiations of the organism,
each evolved from those which preceded it, all sharing in
a common activity, all <i>inter</i>-dependent.</p>

<p>32. That co-operation of the Personality which is conspicuous
in conscious actions is also inductively to be
inferred in sub-conscious and unconscious actions. We
know that a man reacts on an impression according to his
physical and mental state at the moment—that through
his individuality he feels differently, and thinks differently
from other men, and from himself at other epochs,
and in other states. Because he resembles other men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
many and essential points we conclude that he will
resemble them in all; but observation proves this conclusion
to be precipitate. Other men see a blue color
in the sky, or feel awe at sight of the setting sun; but
he has perhaps not learned to discriminate this sensation,
is not conscious of the blue; nor has he learned to feel
awe at the setting sun. Why—having normally constructed
eyes—does he not see the blue of the sky?
For the same reason that a dog, or an infant, fails to see
it. The color has no <i>interest</i> for him (and all cognition is
primarily emotion), nor has this want of personal interest
been rectified from an impersonal source: he has never
been taught to distinguish the color of the sky; and his
eye wanders over it with the indifferent gaze with which
a savage would regard a Greek codex.</p>

<p>33. The point here insisted on, namely, that every
reaction on an impression is indirectly the reaction of
the whole organism, and that no organ detached from the
organism has more significance than a word detached from
a sentence, is of far-reaching importance, and peculiarly
worthy of attention in considering the Reflex Theory,
because almost all the evidence urged in support of that
theory presupposes the legitimacy of concluding what
takes place in the organism from what is observed in an
organ detached from its normal connections. No experimental
proof is necessary to show that many actions take
place unconsciously; the fact is undisputed. But does
unconsciously mean insentiently? It is certain that the
unconscious actions take place in a sentient organism, and
involve organic processes of the same <i>order</i> as the actions
which are conscious. It is also certain that many sentient
processes take place unconsciously. For thousands
of years men used their eyes, and saw as their descendants
see, yet were unconscious of the blue sky and green
of the grass. Were their visual reactions not of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
<i>order</i> as our own? So far as the optic apparatus is concerned,
there cannot be a doubt on the point; yet in them
the sensorium having a somewhat different disposition—the
neural elements being differently combined—their
reactions correspondingly differed. They too had optical
Sensibility, and visual sensations; but they did not feel
precisely what we feel.</p>

<p>34. I have chosen these somewhat remote illustrations
for the sake of their psychological interest; but I might
have confined myself to more familiar examples. Thus
the contents of the consciousness of a man born blind
cannot be <i>the same</i> as the contents of one who has had
visual experiences, which will enter into the complex of
every conscious state, because the visual organs will have
affected his sensorium; nevertheless in the organism of
the blind man there are conditions so similar to those
of other men, and his experiences will have been so similar,
that in spite of the modifications due to the absence
of visual experiences, his consciousness will in the main
resemble theirs. But now let us in imagination pursue
this kind of modification, let us take away hearing, taste,
and smell, and we shall have proportionately simplified
the contents of consciousness—the reactions of the sensorium—in
thus simplifying the organism. There still
will remain Touch, Temperature, Pain, and the Systemic
Sensations. There will still remain an organism to react
on impressions. So long as there is a living organism,
however truncated, there is a sentient mechanism. When
the brain has been removed, the removal causes both a
<i>disturbance</i> of function and a <i>loss</i> of function; the mechanism
has been seriously interfered with; yet all those
parts of the mechanism which still co-operate manifest
their physiological aptitudes. The animal can live without
its brain, <i>ergo</i> it can feel without its brain. Observation
proves this, for it discovers the brainless animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
manifesting various sensibilities, and combining various
movements. The vision of the brainless animal is greatly
impaired, but it nevertheless persists. The intelligence is
greatly impaired, the spontaneity is reduced to a minimum;
but still both intelligence and spontaneity are
manifested.</p>

<p>35. The physiologist has only two conclusions open to
him. Either he holds Sensation to be a <i>property</i> of nerve-tissue—and
in that case he must assign it to the spinal
cord as to the brain; or else he holds Sensation to be a
<i>function</i> of an organ—and in that case, although analytically
he may decompose the organism into separate
organs, assigning special sensations to the reactions of
each, he must still admit that in reality these organs only
yield sensations as component parts of the organism.
The notion of a separate organ, such as the brain, being
the exclusive seat of sensation is thus seen to be untenable.</p>

<p>In popular phrase, “it is not the eye which sees, but the
mind behind the eye.” It is not the stimulus which is
the <i>object</i> felt—it is the change in consciousness—the
reaction of the sensorium. No one would propound the
absurdity that the retinal cells <i>see</i>, or the auditory cells
<i>hear</i> (although by a conventional ellipsis these cells are
said to be “percipient” of colors and sounds), yet many
writers have no hesitation in asserting that the cerebral
cells are the seats of these and all other sensations. In a
hundred treatises may be read the most precise description
of the transformation of molecular changes in the
retinal cells into molecular changes in the cerebral cells,
where, it is said, “we know that the stimulations become
sensations.” Now who knows this? How can it be
known? Nay, who, on reflection, fails to see that this cannot
be so? If a sensation of sight were not much <i>more</i>
than a molecular change in the cerebrum stimulated by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
molecular change in the optic tract, three conclusions would
follow, each of which is demonstrably <span class="locked">erroneous:—</span></p>

<p>I. The cerebrum in a decapitated animal would respond
by a sensation of sight to a retinal stimulation.</p>

<p>II. The animal deprived of its cerebrum could not respond
by a sensation of sight to a retinal stimulation.</p>

<p>III. The same retinal stimulation would always produce
the same cerebral process and the same sensation;
whereas the sensation depends on the condition of the
sensorium at the time.</p>

<p>36. The difference between the Reflex Theory and that
here upheld is important in its general relations, and yet
turns on a point which may easily appear insignificant.
The Reflex Theory asserts that when a sensory nerve is
stimulated, the excitation of the centre may either subdivide
into two waves, one of which passes directly to the
brain and there awakens sensation, the other passes over
to the motor-roots and causes muscular contractions; or, instead
of thus subdividing, the wave may pass at once to the
motor-nerves, and then there is movement without sensation.
This is obviously a restatement in anatomical terms
of the observed fact that some reflexes take place consciously
and some unconsciously. But what evidence is
there for this anatomical statement? We have seen that
there is none. According to all we actually know, and
reasonably infer, the continuity of tissue and the irradiation
of excitation are such that the stimulus wave must
always affect the whole system, so that brain and cord
being structurally united, their reactions must co-operate
with varying energy dependent on their statical conditions
at the time.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
37. The physiological fact that the irradiation is <i>restricted</i>
to certain paths, and therefore only certain portions
of the whole system are excited to discharge—the
fact that stimulation takes effect along the lines of least
resistance—is that which gives the Reflex Theory its
plausible aspect. But this fact of restriction is not dependent
on an <i>anatomical</i> disposition of structure, it is,
as we have already seen (<span class="smcap">Problem</span> II. § <a href="#II_166">166</a>), dependent
on a fluctuating physiological disposition—a temporary
statical condition of the centres. And it enables us to
understand why the reflex action which is at one moment
a distinctly conscious or even a volitional action, is at
another sub-conscious or unconscious. When an object is
placed in the hand of an infant the fingers close over it
by a simple reflex. This having also been observed in the
case of an infant born without a brain,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> one might interpret
it as normally taking place without brain co-operation,
were there not good grounds for concluding that
normally the brain must co-operate. Thus if the object
be placed in the hand of a boy, or a man, the fingers will
close, or not close—not according to an anatomical mechanism,
but according to a physiological condition: if the
attention preoccupy his sensorium elsewhere, his fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
will probably close, probably not; if his sensorium be
directed towards the object, either by the urgency of the
sensitive impression, or by some one’s pointing to the object,
the fingers will close or not close, just as he chooses—perhaps
the hand will be suddenly drawn away. The
centre of innervation for the fingers is in the cord, and
from this comes the final discharge of the sensitive stimulation;
but the neural processes which preceded this discharge,
and were consequent on the stimulation, were in
each case somewhat different. In each case the impression
on the skin was carried to the cord, and thence
irradiated throughout the continuous neural axis, restricted
to certain paths by the resistance it met with,
but blending with waves of simultaneous excitations from
other sources, the final discharge being the resultant of
these component forces. We may suppose the brain to
be the seat of consciousness, and yet not conclude that
the brain was unaffected because the fingers closed unconsciously;
any more than we conclude that the retina
of the unoccupied eye is unaffected by light when with
the other we are looking through a microscope, and only
<i>see</i> objects with this eye—though directly we attend to
the impressions on the other eye we see the objects which
before were unseen. We know that the muscles of the
back are all involved in walking, standing, etc., but we
are seldom conscious of their co-operation till rheumatism
or lumbago makes us painfully alive to it.</p>

<p>38. The two main positions of the Reflex Theory are,
1°, that reflex actions take place without brain co-operation,—as
proved by observation of decapitated animals;
2°, that they take place without brain co-operation,—as
proved by our being unconscious of them.</p>

<p>To these the answers are: 1°. The proof drawn from
observation of decapitated animals is defective, because
the conditions of the organism are then abnormal—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
is a disturbance of the mechanism, and a loss of some of
its components. The fact that a reflex occurs in the
absence of the brain is no proof that reflexes when the
brain is present occur without its participation. 2°. The
absence of consciousness cannot be accepted as proof of
the brain not being in action, because much brain-work
is known to pass unconsciously, and there are cerebral reflexes
which have the same characters as spinal reflexes.</p>

<p>39. A prick on the great toe traverses the whole length
of the spinal axis with effects manifested in various organs—the
muscles of the limb, the heart, the chest, the
eyes, etc. The leg is withdrawn, the heart momently
arrested, the eyes turned towards the source of irritation,
the thoughts directed towards relief. These effects can
be observed—there are others which lie beyond our observation,
and can only be revealed by delicate experimental
tests. But even the observable effects are very
fluctuating, because they depend on fluctuating conditions.
All we can say is, that so long as there is continuity
of structure, there must be continuity of excitation;
and the brain structurally connected with the centre
of a sensory impression, must necessarily co-operate more
or less in the reactions of that centre. In other words,
the brain, although not the exclusive seat of sensation,
plays a part in every particular sensation, so long as it
forms a part of the stimulated organism.</p>

<p>40. This view being so widely opposed to the views
current in physiological schools, I was gratified to find
Dr. Crichton Browne led by his researches to a conclusion
not unlike it in essential features. In his essay on
the Functions of the Optic Thalami<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> (well worthy of
attention on other grounds) he says: “Allowing the spinal
cord a power of independent action, it may still be
that it generally acts reflexly through, or in association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
with, a superior centre. The sensorial ganglia can undoubtedly
act alone in a reflex manner, but they almost
invariably consult the cerebrum before dealing with the
impressions which they receive; so it may be that the
spinal cord, though capable of spontaneous reaction, may
yet commonly refer to some higher seat of compound co-ordination
before sending forth an answer to any message
brought to it.” What is here stated as a possible and
occasional process, I consider to be a necessary and universal
process. Dr. Browne acutely remarks that if “what
may be termed the encephalic loop were an integral part
of every reflex act, then the influence of an intracranial
lesion in checking reflex action would not be difficult to
understand”—and we may add the notorious influence
of the brain in arresting reflex actions, and modifying
them by the will, which is only explicable on the supposition
that the cerebral and spinal centres are functionally
associated. Dr. Browne further remarks: “In experimenting
upon myself I have sometimes thought that
when the toe is pricked the sensation of pain actually
precedes the movement of withdrawal; and in experimenting
upon patients with sluggish nervous systems I
have certainly noticed that after the pricking of the toe
the little cry of pain has anticipated the muscular contractions
of the leg. Now this cry of pain is a secondary
reflex act through the sensorial centre; it is the result of
a discharge from efferent nerves from the summit of what
we have spoken of as the encephalic loop line; and we
should certainly not expect that it would be developed
earlier than the primary reflexion upon the motor apparatus,
unless indeed what we have regarded as the primary
reflexion really itself took place by way of the loop line.”</p>

<p>41. The difference between a voluntary and involuntary
act is not, I conceive, that in the one case the brain
co-operates and in the other is inactive, but that while in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
both the brain co-operates, the state of the sensorium
known as mental prevision or ideal stimulation, is present
in the one, and absent or less conspicuous in the other.
So likewise the difference between a normal reflex action
accompanied, and the same action unaccompanied by consciousness,
is not that the brain co-operates in the one
and is inactive in the other, but that the state of the sensorium
is somewhat different in the two cases. Movements
which originally were voluntary and difficult of
execution—accompanied therefore by brain co-operation—become
by frequent repetition automatic, easy of execution,
and unconscious—they are then said to depend
on the direct action of the established mechanism.
Granted. But what are the components of this mechanism?
Are they not just those centres and organs which
at first effected the movements? In becoming easy and
automatic, the movements do not <i>change their mechanism</i>—the
moving organs and the motor conditions remain
what they were; all that is changed is the degree of consciousness,
i. e. the <i>state</i> of the sensorium which precedes
and succeeds the movement. It is this which constitutes
the difficulty of the question. Some readers may consider
that all is conceded when unconsciousness is admitted.
But this is not so. My present argument is the
physiological one that the brain co-operates in reflex
actions whenever the brain is structurally united with the
reflex centres; the psychological question as to whether
consciousness is also involved in this brain co-operation
must be debated on other grounds; and we have already
seen that consciousness operates in gradations of infinite
delicacy.</p>

<p>Observe a man performing some automatic action, such
as planing a deal board, or cutting out a pattern, which
he has done so often that he is now able to do it “mechanically.”
It is certain that his brain co-operates, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
that he could not act thus with an injured brain; yet
he is said to act unconsciously, his brain occupied elsewhere
as he whistles, talks to bystanders, or thinks of
his wife and children. Yet the brain is acting as an overseer
of his work, attentive to every stroke of the plane,
every snip of the scissors; and this becomes evident
directly his attention is otherwise absorbed by an interesting
question addressed to him, or an interesting object
meeting his eye: then the work pauses, his hands are
arrested, and the automatic action will only be resumed
when his attention is released—when he has answered
your question, or satisfied himself about the object.</p>

<p>42. This is a step towards understanding the co-operation
of the brain even in those connate reflexes which
were not originally voluntary acts, but were from the
first organized tendencies, and are capable of being realized
in the absence of the brain. I admit that it is difficult
to find proof of brain co-operation here, though I
think the anatomical and physiological evidence render
it highly probable. But distinct proof to the contrary
would not suffice for the Reflex Theory—would not
prove that reflex actions were insentient—unless there
had previously been proved that which seems to me contradicted
by the clearest and most massive evidence,
namely, that the brain is the sole seat of sentience. This
contradictory evidence we will now furnish.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV_III" class="vspace">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="subhead">INDUCTIONS FROM PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>43. <span class="firstword">In</span> the last chapter we surveyed the deductive evidence,
from which the conclusion was that Reflexion
necessarily involves Sensibility, but not necessarily any
one particular <i>mode</i> of Sensibility, such as Consciousness,
Pain, Discomfort, Attention, or the reaction of any one
of the special Senses. Although each or all of these
modes may be involved in the sensorial process which
determines a reflex act, each or all may be absent. Such
is the fact of observation. This fact is interpreted on
the hypothesis that Reflexion is the exclusive property
of the spinal cord, as Sensation is of the brain. When
we come to examine the evidence for this hypothesis, we
find it to move in a circle: the brain is said to be the
exclusive seat of sensation, because reflex actions can be
effected after its removal; and reflex actions are said to
be insentient because they take place in the absence of
the brain.</p>

<p>A gentleman was one day stoutly asserting that there
were no gold-fields except in Mexico and Peru. A nugget,
dug up in California, was presented to him, as evidence
against his positive assertion. He was not in the
least disconcerted. “This metal, sir, is, I own, extremely
<i>like</i> gold; and you tell me that it passes as such in the
market, having been declared by the assayers to be undistinguishable
from the precious metal. All this I will
not dispute. Nevertheless, the metal is not gold, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
<i>auruminium</i>; it cannot be gold, <i>because</i> gold comes only
from Mexico and Peru.” In vain was he informed that
the geological formation was similar in California and
Peru, and the metals similar; he had fixed in his mind
the conclusion that gold existed <i>only</i> in Mexico and Peru:
this was a law of nature; he had no reasons to give why
it should be so; but such had been the admitted fact
for many years, and from it he would not swerve. He
was not fond of new-fangled notions, which, after all,
would only lead us back to the exploded errors of the
past. To accept the statement that gold was to be found
elsewhere than in Mexico and Peru, would be to return
to the opinion of the ancients, who thought there was
gold in the upper regions of Tartary!</p>

<p>Sensation is not tangible, assayable, like gold. We can
understand, therefore, that the very men who would make
merry with the <i>auruminium</i>, would accept easily such a
phrase as “reflex action.” The decapitated animal defends
itself against injury, gets out of the way of annoyances,
cleans itself, performs many of its ordinary actions,
but is said to do these things without that Sensibility
which, if its head were on, would guide them. Even before
the Reflex Theory was invented this line of argument
was used. Gall, referring to the experiments of
Sue, previously noticed, says that “Sue confounds the
effects of Irritability with those of Sensibility.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> Not
gold, dear sir, but <i>auruminium</i>!</p>

<p>44. On investigating the phenomena we soon come
upon two classes which must cause hesitation. We find
that the brain has its reflex processes, of the same order
as those of the cord; we find that these processes may
be conscious or unconscious, voluntary or involuntary;
so that we can no longer separate brain from cord on the
ground of Reflexion. In this respect, at least, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
are mechanisms with similar powers. Turning now to
the other class of phenomena, we find that precisely as
the brain is an organ of Reflexion, the cord is an organ
of Sensation. All the evidence we can have, from which
to infer the presence of sensation, is furnished by the
sensorial processes in the cord. Remove the brain, and
the animal still manifests Sensibility, and this in degrees
of energy and complexity proportional to the mechanisms
still intact: some of these manifestations have the character
of volitional actions, some of automatic actions,
some of Memory, Judgment, and selective Adaptation.
These we observe not indeed with the energy and variety
of such manifestations when the brain co-operates, since
the disturbance of the organism which is the consequence
of the brain’s removal—or the meagreness of the organism
which is the correlative of the brain never having
been developed—must of course involve a corresponding
difference in the observed phenomena; but the point here
brought forward is that phenomena of the same <i>order</i> are
manifested by organisms with or without a brain.</p>

<p>45. Let us go seriatim through the evidence of these
two <span class="locked">classes:—</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_30">CEREBRAL REFLEXES.</h3>

<p>While Theory separated the actions of the cord from
those of the brain on the ground of their being at times
unconscious and involuntary, Observation disclosed that
this distinction could not be maintained.</p>

<p>This step was taken by Dr. Laycock in 1840. In a
striking paper<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> read by him at the British Association in
1844, he brought together the evidence on which his view
was founded. The idea has been adopted and illustrated
in the writings of Dr. Carpenter, who now calls the action
“unconscious cerebration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
“I was led to this opinion,” Dr. Laycock says in announcing
his view, “by the general principle that the
ganglia within the cranium, being a continuation of the
spinal cord, must necessarily be regulated as to their reaction
on external agencies by laws identical with those
governing the spinal ganglia and their analogues in the
lower animals. If, therefore, the spinal cord is a centre
of reflexion, the brain must also be one.” It is a matter
of regret that Dr. Laycock did not extend this principle,
and declare that whatever was true of the <i>properties</i> of
the cranial centres must also be true of the spinal centres;
if the brain have Sensibility, the spinal cord must
also have it.</p>

<p>Dr. Laycock refers to the curious phenomena of Hydrophobia
in proof that reflex actions may be excited by the
optic nerves, or by a mere idea of water. When a mirror
was presented to a patient, the reflexion of the light acting
on his retina, in the manner of a reflexion from the
surface of water, produced a convulsive sobbing, as in the
attempt to swallow water, and the patient turned aside
his head with expressions of terror. Money was given
him to induce him to look a second time, but before he
had looked a minute the same effect was produced.</p>

<p>The <i>idea</i> of water excited similar convulsions. No
sooner was it suggested that the patient should swallow
a little water than he seemed frightened, and began to
cry out. By kindly encouragements he was brought to
express his willingness to drink, but the <i>sound</i> of the
water, as it was poured out again, brought on convulsions.
In another case, “on our proposing to him to drink, he
started up, and recovered his breath by a deep convulsive
inspiration. On being urged to try, he took a cup of
water in one hand and a spoon in the other. With as
expression of terror, yet with great resolution, he filled
the spoon and proceeded to carry it to his lips; but before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
it reached his mouth his courage forsook him, and he
was forced to desist. He repeatedly renewed the attempt,
but with no more success. His arm became rigid and
immovable whenever he tried to raise it to his mouth,
and he struggled in vain against this spasmodic resistance.”</p>

<p>In 1843 Griesinger—who appears to have known
nothing of Dr. Laycock’s paper—published his remarkably
suggestive memoir on Psychical Reflexes,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> in which
he extends the principle of Reflexion to all the cerebro-spinal
centres. The whole course of subsequent research
has confirmed this view; so that we may say with Landry,
“L’existence du pouvoir réflexe dans l’encéphale ou
dans quelques unes de ses parties établit une nouvelle
analogie entre le centre nerveux cranien et la moelle
épinière.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Indeed we have only to consider the Laughter
which follows a ludicrous idea, or the Terror which follows
a suggestion of danger,—the varying and involuntary
expression of Emotion,—and the curious phenomena
of Imitation and Contagion,—to see how large a place
cerebral reflexion occupies.</p>

<p>46. The existence of cerebral reflexion having been
thus made manifest, Dr. Carpenter classed all reflex
actions under three heads: 1°, the excito-motor, determined
by the spinal cord; 2°, the sensori-motor, determined
by the ganglia at the base of the brain; 3°,
ideo-motor, determined by the brain. From all these
Consciousness is absent. From the first, he supposes
Sensation to be absent. As an artifice, such a classification
may have its value, but it is physiologically and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
psychologically misleading. It sustains the hypothesis
of an imaginary excito-motor mechanism. It restricts
Sensibility to one of its many modes. It fails altogether
to connect Sensation with Thought, the Logic of Feeling
with the Logic of Signs.</p>

<p>47. The view of Sensibility as common to the whole
cerebro-spinal axis is by no means new. Robert Whytt
maintained it. Prochaska held that the spinal cord
formed the greater part of the <i>sensorium commune</i>; and
he adduced, in proof, the familiar facts of sensibility
manifested by headless animals. The next writer whom
I can discover to have held this opinion is J. J. Sue,—the
father of the celebrated French romance-writer,—who,
in 1803, conceived that his experiments proved the
spinal cord to be capable of replacing, to a certain extent,
the functions of the brain.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Next came Legallois,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
who undertook to show, by a series of experiments, that
the principle of sensation and movement, in the trunk
and extremities, has its seat in the spinal cord. The
mere division of the cord, he said, produces “the astonishing
result of an animal, in which the head and the
body enjoy separate vitality, the head living as if the
body did not exist, and the body living as if the head did
not exist. Guinea-pigs, after decapitation, seem very sensitive
to the pain caused by the wound in the neck; they
alternately carry first one hind-leg and then the other, to
the spot, as if to scratch it. Kittens also do the same.”</p>

<p>A few years afterwards, 1817, Dr. Wilson Philip concluded
that “the spinal marrow possesses sensorial power,
as appears from very simple experiments”; but he held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
the brain to be the <i>chief</i> source of sensorial power.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> The
following year, Lallemand supported this opinion by the
very curious phenomena exhibited by infants born without
brains: these infants breathed, swallowed, sucked,
squalled, and gave very unequivocal signs of sensibility.
The value of such observations consists in disproving the
objection frequently urged against the evidence of decapitated
animals, namely, that in these animals the spinal
cord preserves the remains of a sensibility endowed by
the brain.</p>

<p>Longet here places an observation recorded by Beyer.
A new-born infant, whose brain, during the birth, had
been completely extirpated (to save the mother’s life),
was wrapped in a towel, and placed in the corner of the
room, as a lifeless mass. While the surgeon was giving
all his care to the mother, he heard with horror a kind of
murmur proceeding from the spot where the body had
been placed. In three minutes a distinct <i>cry</i> was heard.
The towel was removed, and, to the surprise of all, this
brainless infant was seen struggling with rapid movement
of its arms and legs. It cried, and gave other signs of
sensibility for several minutes.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>In 1828 Calmeil arrived at the same conclusion as that
reached by Legallois, Wilson Philip, and Lallemand. Indeed
when, in 1833, the Reflex Theory appeared, this
opinion was so firmly rooted, that we find Mr. Grainger
combating it as the established error of the day. He
takes as much pains to show that physiologists are wrong
in attributing sensation to the spinal cord, as I am here
taking to show that they were right.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> “It is, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
apparent,” he says, “that the whole question concerning
the truth or falsehood of the theory which attributes the
reflex power to the spinal cord hinges upon the correctness
or incorrectness of the received doctrines respecting
the seat of sensation and volition; so that until those
doctrines are proved to be false, it is impossible to establish
the hypothesis of Dr. Hall.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>The reader is requested to take note of this, because
when we come to the evidence which proves the spinal
cord to be a centre of sensation, we shall find that the
<i>only</i> ground for rejecting that evidence is the assumed
truth of the Reflex Theory, coupled with the assumption
of the brain being the exclusive seat of sensation.
Whereas if the evidence proves that the spinal cord <i>is</i> a
sensational centre, then the Reflex Theory is destroyed,
and cannot be urged against such evidence.</p>

<p>48. Thus many of the facts which prove the sensational
function of the spinal cord were known, and even
a vague conception of their real significance was general,
until the Reflex Theory came to explain all such facts as
the results of mechanical adjustment, and of a new nervous
principle called “Reflexion.” For many years this
theory has reigned, and met with but little opposition.
Yet the true doctrine has not wanted defenders in Germany.
Nasse<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> denied that decapitated animals showed
no spontaneity; he asserted that they exhibited clear
signs of mental activity. Carus sarcastically pointed out
that the <i>word</i> “reflex” was replacing “irritability,” as a
key to unlock all puzzles; and he took up a position
which is very similar to the one occupied in these pages,
namely, that the spinal cord being formed of gray matter
as well as of fibres, it must have sensibility and power of
reacting on nervous stimulus, no less than conductibility;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
that, in fact, it is a centre, and must act like all other
nerve-centres.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> J. W. Arnold opposed the Reflex Theory
in a very remarkable little work, in which he vindicates
the claim of the spinal cord as a sensory and motor centre,
although denying to its actions any volitional character.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
This was in 1844. Eleven years elapsed without
any further opposition, when Edward Pflüger, in 1853,
published his work on the Sensorial Functions of the
spinal cord.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> In this work he recurred to the old views
of Prochaska and Legallois; but although he attacked
Marshall Hall with merciless severity, he did not point
out the fundamental error of the Reflex Theory, which
theory he seems to accept. Nor did he give his views
that philosophical and anatomical basis which could alone
render his interpretations acceptable. Added to this, the
tone of asperity in which his work was written, created
some prejudice against him; and thus, while many admitted
his facts, they rejected his conclusions.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>In 1858 Professor Owen read a paper of mine at the
Leeds meeting of the British Association, on “The spinal
cord as a centre of Sensation and Volition,” in which a
rapid indication of my point of view, and an account of
some experiments to illustrate it, were given—<i>not</i>, I
believe, conclusive to any of the audience. Indeed, the
subject was too vast to be discussed in such a paper; and
my object was rather to excite new inquiry, than to make
converts to a view which could only be embraced after a
thorough reinvestigation of the dominant theories.</p>

<p>In 1859 appeared Schiff’s work;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> and here we find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
large space allotted to the discussion of Pflüger’s doctrine.
Schiff, whose immense experience as an experimentalist,
and whose acuteness and caution every one will highly
estimate, frankly pronounces in favor of the sensational
character of spinal actions; but he denies that they are
volitional, and objects strongly to the introduction of any
such idea as that of “psychical activity.” He thinks it
utterly untenable to suppose that impressions have reactions
in the brain which they have not in the spinal
cord:—if one has sensibility, the other must have it;
and he thinks that, so far from the actions of the cord
being distinguishable from those of the brain by the
character of “reflexion,” and depending on a mechanical
arrangement—<i>all</i> actions, cerebral or spinal, are reflex;
<i>all</i> depend on a mechanical arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Since that time there has been the remarkable work of
Goltz, so often cited in these pages,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> and his subsequent
experiments on dogs, which (although he does not decisively
adopt the views of Pflüger) furnish ample evidence
that sensation and volition cannot be exclusively localised
in the brain.</p>

<p>49. Heubel’s interesting experiments<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> show that a
frog may be thrown into a state of profound sleep by the
withdrawal of all external stimulation, and in this state
will remain lying on its back for hours. Now this position
is one so very uncomfortable that, when awake, the
frog will not retain it a moment, if free to turn round; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
when asleep, a prick on the toe, a sudden noise, or a beam
of light will awaken it, causing it to turn. That is to
say, the withdrawal of the normal stimuli so lowers the
sensibility of the frog’s nerve-centres, that he does not
feel the effects of the unusual position, but feels them
directly the centres are stimulated into activity. All this
is intelligible enough on the supposition of the state of
sleep being dependent on a lowering of the cerebral
activity. But what shall we say on learning that precisely
the same phenomena are manifested by a brainless
frog? Every one knows that the brainless frog is intolerant
of lying on its back, and immediately turns round,
if placed on it. Yet the brainless frog may be thrown
into deep sleep by the same exclusion of external stimuli;
from which he also will be awakened by a prick, a noise,
or a beam of light; and no sooner is he awakened than
he at once turns round. Were the brainless frog incapable
of sensation, a prick on his toe would cause a
simple reflex withdrawal of the leg; but this is not the
effect; on the contrary, the stimulus excites the whole
spinal cord, and whatever sensation of discomfort may
be caused by the abnormal position of the limbs in an
uninjured awakened frog, is excited in the brainless frog.</p>

<p>50. I need not swell this chapter with examples of
Sensibility in animals deprived of the brain; many have
already been given, and any text-book of Physiology will
supply more. No one disputes the observations, only the
inference that these manifestations were sentient: they
are said to have been merely mechanical reflexes. If,
however, we can detect in them <i>some</i> evidence of what all
recognize as peculiarly characteristic of Mind, the mechanical
interpretation will be less plausible.</p>

<p>At the outset the reader must be warned against exaggerating
and distorting the bearing of my remarks, and
must not suppose that I disregard the vast differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
between the Logic of Signs which belongs to Thought,
and the Logic of Feeling which belongs to Sensation, nor
suppose that I look upon the spinal cord as a mental
organ having the <i>same</i> functions as the brain. All that
I wish to establish is the common character of spinal and
cerebral processes, modified as each is by the character of
the actions initiated by the process.</p>

<p>51. This premised, let us begin with the evidence of</p>

<h3 id="sec_31">DISCRIMINATION.</h3>

<p>Although this process is usually regarded as purely
psychological, it must obviously have its physiological
side; we find it in Sensation as in Ideation, and may expect
to find it in unconscious as in conscious processes—in
a word, in all sensorial processes whatever. Place a
bit of marble on your tongue, and it will be touched, but
not tasted: the sensations of contact and temperature will
excite reflexes, but little or no reflexes from parotid and
salivary glands. A difference in sensation has a corresponding
difference in reflex action; which may be made
evident by removing the tasteless marble, and replacing
it by a pinch of carbonate of lime, i. e. the marble in another
state reduced to a powder: this will excite a sensation
of taste, and a secretion from the glands. In both
cases your sentient organism was affected, but it reacted
differently because the difference of the stimulation was
discriminated: consciously or unconsciously, you <i>felt</i> differently.
Again: touch the back of your mouth with
your finger, or a feather, and a convulsive contraction of
the gullet responds, followed by vomiting, if the excitation
be renewed. Yet these same nerves and muscles
respond by the totally opposite action of swallowing, if
instead of the stimulation coming from your finger, it
come from the pressure of food or drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
Analogous experiments on animals without their brains
yield similar results.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> The salivary secretion and the
ordinary reactions of Taste are provoked by sapid substances.
Still more conclusive are the observations made
on a dog whose spinal cord has been divided, and who
therefore according to the reigning ideas is incapable of
feeling any impression made on parts below the section.
A pencil inserted in the rectum causes a reaction of the
muscles energetically resisting the entrance of this foreign
body; yet this rectum so sensitive in its reaction
on the stimulus of the pencil, responds by the totally
different reaction—the relaxation of the muscles—on
the stimulus of fæcal matters.</p>

<p>52. “This is all mechanical,” you say? Mechanical,
no doubt, as all actions are; but the question here is
whether among the conditions of the mechanical action
Sensibility has a place? The answer can only be grounded
on induction. The actions of the dog are analogous to
the actions which you know were sentient in yourself.
There was in both a discrimination, in both a corresponding
reaction. I admit that what is here called “discrimination”
is the application of a logical term to a mechanical
process; I admit that if the spinal mechanism is
insentient, the fact of discrimination may still be manifested;
but I conceive that the many and coercive grounds
for admitting that the mechanism is sentient gain further
support in the evidence of discrimination. Every particular
sensation has its corresponding reaction; and although
this has been acquired during ancestral or individual
experiences, so that in the majority of cases there
is no consciousness accompanying the operation, this, as
we have seen, is not a valid argument against the existence
of a sensorial process. We have only to lower
the Sensibility of the cord by anæsthetics, or to <i>preoccupy</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
its energies by some other excitation, and the reaction
fails.</p>

<h3 id="sec_32">MEMORY.</h3>

<p>53. “But discrimination, if not a purely physical process,
implies Memory?” No doubt. And what is Memory—on
its physiological side—but an organized tendency
to react on lines previously traversed? As Griesinger
truly says: “There is Memory in all the functions
of the central organs, including the spinal cord. There
is one for reflex actions, no less than for sense-images,
words, and ideas.” Gratiolet makes a similar assertion.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>
Indeed if, as we have seen, reflex actions are partly connate,
and partly acquired, it is obvious that the second
class must involve that very reproduction of experiences,
which in the sphere of Intellect is called Memory.</p>

<p>There is assuredly something paradoxical at first in
this application of the terms of the Logic of Signs, yet
the psychologist will find it of great service. But if the
terms discrimination and memory be objected to, they
may be replaced by some such phrase as the “adaptation
of the mechanism to varying impulses.” On its objective
side, Discrimination is Neural Grouping; on its subjective
side, it is Association of experiences.</p>

<h3 id="sec_33">INSTINCT.</h3>

<p>54. If we can detect evidences of Volition and Instinct
in the absence of the brain, our thesis may be considered
less questionable. And such evidence there is. Goltz
decapitated a male frog (in the pairing season), and observed
that it not only sought, grasped, and energetically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
embraced a female, but could always discriminate a female
from a male. Thus when a male frog closely resembling
a female in size and shape was presented to
this decapitated animal, he clasped it, but rapidly let it
go again, whereas even the dead body of a female was
held as in a vice. Goltz tried to <i>delude</i> this brainless
animal in various ways, always in vain. Only a female
would be held in his embrace. Goltz then presented a
female in a reversed position, so that the head was grasped
by the male. Now here, had there been simply a reflex
machine, incapable of sentient discrimination, the clutched
female would have been held in this position, just like
any other object which excited the reflex; there would
have been no “sense of incongruity,” such as Goltz noticed
in his frog, who at once began a series of movements
by which he was enabled, without letting the female
escape, to bring her into the proper position. To
render this observation still more significant, I may add
that Goltz did not find all male frogs act thus—many
relinquished the female thus improperly presented to
them. Such phenomena observed in frogs possessing
brains, would be accepted as evidence of sexual instinct
and volition.</p>

<p>Further: Goltz removed the brain from a frog, which
he then held under water, gently pressing the body so as
to drive the air out of its lungs; the body being then
heavier than the water sank to the bottom, where it remained
motionless. He repeated this procedure with another
frog, not brainless but blinded. This one sank also,
but in a few minutes rose to the surface to breathe. This
difference naturally suggests that the brainless frog was
insensible of the condition which in the other caused a
movement of relief. The one felt impending suffocation,
the other felt nothing. Such was the interpretation of
a German friend in whose presence I repeated the experiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
But I had been instructed by Goltz, and bade
my friend wait awhile. He did so, and saw the brainless
frog slowly rise to the surface and breathe there like his
blinded companion. So that the only difference observable
was in the lessened sensibility of the brainless frog.</p>

<p>55. But Goltz records a still more conclusive case. In
a large vessel of water he inverted a glass jar also containing
water, which could then only be retained in the
jar by atmospheric pressure. Through the neck of this
inverted jar he thrust a blinded frog, not having pressed
the air out of its lungs. It rose at once in the jar, touching
the inverted bottom with its nose, and when the
necessity of fresh air was felt, the frog began restlessly
feeling about the surface of its prison till an issue was
found in the neck of the jar, through which it dashed
into the vessel, and at once rose to the surface of the
water to breathe. In this observation are plainly manifested
the stimulation of uneasy sensation, the volition
of seeking relief, and the discrimination of it when found.
If this frog was a sentient mechanism, what shall we say
to the fact that a brainless frog was observed to go through
precisely the same series of actions? Goltz pertinently
remarks: “So long as physiologists satisfied themselves
that the brain was the sole organ of sensation, it was
easy to declare all the actions of the brainless animal
to be merely reflex. But now we must ask whether the
greater part of these actions are not due to the <i>power of
adaptation</i> in the central organs, and are therefore to be
struck out of the class of simple reflexes? If I bind one
leg of a brainless frog and observe that he not only
sees an obstacle, but crawls aside from it, I must regard
these movements as regulated by his central power of
adaptation; but now suppose I unbind the leg and remove
the obstacle, then if I prick the frog he hops forward.
Must I now declare this hop to have been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
simple reflex? Not at all. In both cases the physiological
processes have been similar.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>56. There are no doubt readers who will dismiss all
evidence drawn from experiments on frogs, as irrelevant
to mammals and man. Let us therefore see how the
evidence stands with respect to animals higher in the
scale, endowed with less questionable mental faculties.
In a former chapter (<span class="smcap">Problem II.</span> § <a href="#II_29">29</a>) we recorded the
marked results of removing the cerebral hemispheres;
and at the same time suggested that these by no means
justified the conclusion usually drawn respecting the
hemispheres as the exclusive seat of sensation. And this
on two grounds: First, because the absence of some sensitive
phenomena does not prevent the presence of others:
the mutilated organism is still capable of manifesting
Sensibility in those organs which remain intact. Secondly,
because were the mutilation followed by total destruction
of Sensibility, this would not prove Sensibility
in the normal organism to have its seat in the part injured.
If the removal of a pin will destroy the chronometric
action of a watch, we do not thence infer that the
chronometric action was the function of this pin. And
this objection has the greater force when we remember
that one hemisphere may be removed without the consequent
loss of a single function, and both may be removed
without the loss of several functions usually ascribed to
cerebral influence.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
57. Consider the analogous effects of injuries to or removal
of the Cerebellum, in causing disturbance of locomotion,
whence the conclusion has been drawn that the
Cerebellum is the exclusive organ of muscular co-ordination,
in spite of the unquestionable evidence that very
many muscular co-ordinations still persist after this organ
is removed. What is the part played by the Cerebellum
I do not pause here to examine.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> I only say that the
movements of swimming, sucking, swallowing, breathing,
crying, micturition, defecation, etc., are co-ordinated as
well after removal of the Cerebellum as they were before,
and that consequently <i>their</i> co-ordination has not its seat
in the Cerebellum. The parallelism is obvious. Removal
of the Cerebrum causes a disturbance in the combination
of sensations, and the execution of certain sense-guided
actions, but causes little appreciable disturbance
in others. Removal of the Cerebellum causes a disturbance
in the combination of certain muscular sensations,
and the execution of certain co-ordinated actions, with
little appreciable disturbance in others.</p>

<p>58. So little have the facts been surveyed and estimated
in their entirety that there is perhaps no subject
on which physiologists are more agreed than on the function
of the Cerebellum being that of co-ordination. Yet
consider this decisive experiment. I etherized three
healthy frogs, from one I removed the entire cranial centres;
from another I removed only the cerebellum; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
leaving the third in possession of an intact encephalon, I
made two sections of the posterior columns of the spinal
cord. The two first hopped, swam, used their legs in defence,
and exhibited a variety of muscular co-ordinations,
although in both the supposed organ of co-ordination was
absent. Whereas the third, which had this organ intact,
and was capable of moving each limb separately, and
each pair of limbs separately, was utterly incapable of
moving all four simultaneously. Why was this? Obviously
because in the first two frogs the motor mechanism
remained intact, and only the cerebral and cerebellar influence
was removed; in the third frog the sensory part
of the motor mechanism had been divided, and no combination
of the limbs was possible.</p>

<p>59. Physiological induction agrees with anatomical induction
in assigning to the cerebrum and cerebellum the
office of <i>incitation</i> and <i>regulation</i> rather than of <i>innervation</i>;
for, as we have seen, no nerve issues directly from
them (<span class="smcap">Problem II.</span> § <a href="#II_7">7</a>). Consequently the effects of injuries
to these centres are losses of spontaneity and of
complexity in the manifestations. Inasmuch as in the
intact organism all sensory impressions are propagated
throughout the nervous centres, the reactions of these
highest centres will enter into the complex of every adjusted
movement; so the abolition of these centres will
be the dropping of a link in the chain, the abolition of a
special element in the complex group. The organs which
are still intact will react, each in its own way, on being
stimulated; but the reaction will be without the modifying
influence of the absent centres. For instance, the
retinal stimulation from a luminous impression normally
calls up a cluster of associated feelings derived originally
from other senses, and a perception of the object is associated
with emotions of desire, terror, etc., according to
the past history of the organism, and its organized reactions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
due to hereditary or acquired experiences. It is
these which form the complex feeling discharged in the
particular movement of prehension, or flight. Remove the
brain, and there can be no longer <i>this</i> cluster of associated
neural groups excited; there will be therefore no emotion,
simply the visual sensation, and such a movement
as is directly associated with it. The brainless dog moans
when hurt, it does not bark at the cat which it nevertheless
sees, and avoids as a mere obstacle in its path; the
cat will cry, it will not mew. The present pain moves
the vocal organs, but does not revive associated experiences.
All those combinations by which a series of
dependent actions result from a single stimulation are
frustrated when the mechanism is disturbed, so that the
mutilated animal can no longer recognize its prey or its
enemy, to feed on the one and fly from the other; no
longer builds its habitation, or rears its offspring. It can
still live, feed, sleep, move, and defend itself against present
discomfort; it cannot find its food, or protect itself
against prospective discomfort. We must supply the
place of its Intelligence. We must give it the food, and
protect it from injuries.</p>

<p>There is therefore ample evidence to show that what is
specially known as Intelligence is very imperfect after
the cerebral influence has been abolished; but this does
not prove the Cerebrum to be the exclusive seat of Intelligence,
it only proves it to be an indispensable factor in
a complex of factors. Still less does it prove the Cerebrum
to be the exclusive seat of Sensation, Instinct, Volition;
for these may be manifested after its removal,
although of course even these will be impaired by the
loss of one factor.</p>

<p>60. And here an objection must be anticipated. In
spite of the familiar experience that one mode of Sensibility
may be destroyed without involving the destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
of other modes, there is a general belief—derived from a
mistaken conception of what is really represented by the
unity of Consciousness—that Consciousness disappears
altogether when it disappears at all; and hence, since
Sensation is supposed to imply Consciousness, it also
cannot be divisible, but must vanish altogether if it vanish
at all. The first answer is that Sensation as an abstraction
is neither divisible nor indivisible; but as a
generalized expression of concrete sensorial processes it is
reducible to these processes, and divisible as they are.
No one doubts that we may lose a whole class of special
sensations—sight, hearing, pain, temperature, etc.—yet
retain all the others. No one doubts that we may lose a
whole class of registered experiences—forget a language,
or lose memory of places so familiar as the streets of
the small town we inhabit, or of faces so familiar as those
of friends and relatives, while the names of these streets
and friends are still remembered when the sounds are
heard. Yet sensation and intelligence are not wholly lost.
The mind is still erect amid these ruins.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>61. This premised, let us consider the experimental
evidence. Flourens declares that when he removed the
whole of the Cerebrum from pigeons and fowls, they lost
<i>all</i> sensation, <i>all</i> perception, <i>all</i> instinct, and <i>all</i> volition.
They lived perfectly well for months after the operation,
if the food were placed in their mouths; but they never
<i>sought</i> their food; they never <i>took</i> it, even when their
beaks were plunged into it: they could swallow, and digest
the grains; but they had no instinct to make them seek,
no volition to make them pick up the grains. They <i>saw</i>
nothing, although the iris remained irritable; they heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
nothing; they could not smell. A state of stupor came
on, resembling that of deep sleep. All voluntary action
ceased. If they were thrown into the air, they flew; if
irritated, they moved away; but if left to themselves, they
remained motionless, with the head under the wing, as in
sleep. Now, inasmuch as these effects always ensue when
the Cerebrum is removed, and <i>never</i> when only the Cerebellum
is removed, he concludes that all instincts, volitions,
and sensations “belong exclusively to the cerebral
lobes.”</p>

<p>But all experimenters do not agree in other points
named by Flourens; nor in the conclusions he has drawn.
On the contrary, it is very certain, and we find evidence
even in Flourens himself, that all instincts and all sensations
are <i>not</i> destroyed by the removal of the cerebral
lobes.</p>

<p>62. Let us hear Bouillaud on this subject.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> He repeated
the experiment of Flourens, removing the whole
of the Cerebrum from the Brain of a fowl; and he thus
records his observations: “This fowl passes the greater
part of her time asleep, but she awakes at intervals, and
<i>spontaneously</i>. When she goes to sleep, she turns her
head on one side and buries it in the feathers of the wing;
when she awakes, she shakes herself, flaps her wings, and
opens her eyes. In this respect there is no difference observable
between the mutilated and the perfect bird. She
does not seem to be moved at all by the noise made round
about her, but a very slight irritation of the skin suffices
to awaken her instantaneously. When the irritation
ceases, she relapses into sleep. When awake, she is often
seen to cast stupid glances here and there, <i>to change her
place, and walk spontaneously</i>. If put into a cage, <i>she
tries to escape</i>; but she comes and goes without any purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
or rational design. When either foot, wing, or head
is pinched, she withdraws it; when she is laid hold of,
she <i>struggles to escape, and screams</i>; but no sooner is she
liberated than she rests motionless. If severely irritated,
she screams loudly; but it is not only to express pain that
she uses her voice, for it is by no means rare to <i>hear her
cackle and cluck a little spontaneously</i>; that is to say, when
no external irritation affects her. Her stupidity is profound;
she knows neither objects nor places, nor persons,
and is completely divested of memory in this respect:
not only does she not know how to seek or take food, she
does not even know how to swallow it when placed in her
beak—it must be pushed to the throat. Nevertheless
her indocility, her movements, her agitation, attest that
she <i>feels</i> the presence of a strange body. Inasmuch as
external objects excite in her no idea, no desire, she pays
no attention to them; but she is not absolutely deprived
of the power of attention, for if much irritated her attention
is awakened. She knows not how to escape an enemy,
nor how to defend herself. All her actions, in a word, are
blind, without reflexion, without knowledge.”</p>

<p>In this recital, the evidence both of <i>sensation</i> and <i>instinct</i>
is incontestable, to any unprejudiced mind. Bouillaud,
in commenting on his observations, remarks, that
assuredly <i>all</i> sensation was not destroyed, since the sensibilities
of touch and pain were very manifest. Nor is it
certain, he says, that the fowl heard nothing, saw nothing.
It is true that she stumbled against objects, and knew not
how to avoid them. She opened her eyes on awaking,
looked about, and showed a sensibility in the pupil to
light; which, he thinks, is incompatible with the absence
of all sensation of sight</p>

<p>63. The experiments of Longet<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> seem decisive on this
latter point. Having removed the whole of the Cerebrum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
from a pigeon, he observed that whenever he
approached a light brusquely to its eyes, there was contraction
of the pupil, and even winking; but, what was
still more remarkable, “when I gave a rotatory motion to
the candle, and at such a distance that there could be no
sensation of heat, the pigeon made a similar movement
with its head. These observations, renewed several times
in the presence of persons who were at my lectures, left
no doubt of the persistence of sensibility to light after
removal of the cerebral lobes.” We have only to think of
the baby following with its eyes the light moved before
it, to understand the kind of impression produced by the
candle on the pigeon. Longet also declares that his experiments
prove the existence of sensations of sound, after
removal of the whole cerebrum.</p>

<p>64. Dr. Dalton, giving the results of numerous experiments
he performed, says that removal of the Cerebrum
plunges the animal in “a profound stupor, in which he is
<i>almost</i> entirely inattentive to surrounding objects....
Occasionally the bird opens its eyes with a vacant stare,
stretches his neck, perhaps shakes his bill once or twice,
or smoothes down the feathers upon his shoulders, and
then relapses into his former apathetic condition. This
state of immobility, however, is <i>not</i> accompanied by the
loss of sight, of hearing, or of ordinary sensibility. <i>All
these functions remain, as well as that of voluntary motion.</i>
If a pistol be discharged behind the back of the animal,
he at once opens his eyes, moves his head half round, and
gives evident signs of having heard the report; but he
immediately becomes quiet again, and pays no further
attention to it. Sight is also retained, since the bird will
sometimes fix its eye on a particular object, and watch it
for several seconds together.”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>While, therefore, Flourens concludes from his experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
that the Cerebrum is the seat of <i>all</i> sensation and
all volition; and Bouillaud concludes that it is most probably
the seat of <i>none</i>; Dr. Dalton concludes that the
functions of the Cerebrum are restricted to those usually
classed as intellectual. “The animal,” he says, “is still
capable, after removal of the hemispheres, of receiving
sensations from external objects. But these sensations
appear to make upon him no lasting impression. He is
incapable of connecting with his perceptions any distinct
succession of ideas. He hears, for example, the report
of a pistol, but he is not alarmed by it; for the sound,
although distinctly perceived, does not suggest any idea
of danger or injury. The memory is altogether destroyed,
and the recollection of sensations is not retained from one
moment to another. The limbs and muscles are still
under the control of the will; but the will itself is inactive,
because apparently it lacks its usual mental stimulus
and direction.”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>Dr. Dalton reminds us how disturbance of the cerebral
functions in human beings recalls these observations on
animals. “In cases of impending apoplexy, or of softening
of the cerebral substance, among the earliest and most
common phenomena is a loss or impairment of the memory.
The patient forgets the names of particular objects,
or particular persons; or he is unable to calculate numbers
with his usual facility. His mental derangement is
often shown in the undue estimate which he forms of
passing events. He is no longer able to appreciate the
true relation between different objects and different phenomena.
Thus he will show an exaggerated degree of
solicitude about a trivial occurrence, and will pay no attention
to other matters of importance. As the difficulty
increases, he becomes careless of the directions and advice
of his attendants, and must be watched and managed like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
a child or an imbecile. After a certain period he no longer
appreciates the lapse of time, and even loses the distinction
between day and night. Finally, when the injury
to the hemispheres is complete, the senses may still remain
active and impressible, while the patient is completely
deprived of intelligence and judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>65. Having seen how far other experimenters are from
confirming the conclusions of Flourens, let us glance at
his record of observations, and we shall find there evidence
that <i>all</i> sensation and <i>all</i> volition cannot be localized
in the Cerebrum. Speaking of a fowl whose Cerebrum
was removed the day before, he says: “She shakes
her head and feathers, sometimes even she cleans and
sharpens them with her beak; sometimes she changes the
leg on which she sleeps, for, like other birds, she sleeps
habitually resting upon one leg. In all these cases she
seems like a man asleep, who, without quite waking,
changes his place, and reposes in another, from the <i>fatigue</i>
occasioned by the previous posture: he selects one more
<i>comfortable</i>, stretches himself, yawns, shakes himself a
little, and falls asleep again.... On the third day the
fowl is no longer so calm; she comes and goes, but without
motive and without an aim; and if she encounters an
obstacle on her path, she knows not how to avoid it.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
In his second work he remarks of a Duck operated on in
the same way: “As I mentioned last year <i>à propos</i> of
fowls, the duck walks about oftener, and for a longer time
together, when it is fasting, than when it is fed.”</p>

<p>Here he observes the unmistakable evidence of feelings
of Hunger, Fatigue, and Discomfort in animals which,
according to him, have lost <i>all</i> sensation. He also observes
the operation of instinct (cleaning the feathers),
and of spontaneous activity (walking about), in animals
said to have lost <i>all</i> instinct and <i>all</i> volition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span></p>

<p id="IV_66">66. Still more decisive are the observations recorded
by other experimenters. Leyden removed the hemispheres
<i>and</i> the ganglia at their base from a hen; yet this
hen moved about and clucked. Meissner noticed that
a pigeon whose hemispheres had been removed always
uttered its <i>coo</i>, and showed restlessness at the usual feeding-time.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
Voit carefully extirpated the cerebrum from
some pigeons, and kept them for many months in health.
For the first few weeks they exhibited the well-known
stupor. Then they began to shake this off, open their
eyes, walk, and fly about <i>spontaneously</i>. They gave unmistakable
signs of seeing and hearing. But the chief
defect was in the inability to feed themselves, and the
complete insensibility to danger. They also manifested
signs of sexual feeling with lively cooings; though quite
unable to gratify their desires.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Vulpian having removed
the cerebrum, optic thalami, and corpora striata from a
young rabbit, found that on pinching its tail it cried out
and struggled to escape; and a rat thus mutilated not
only struggled and cried when pinched, but manifested
strong emotion. “Il est très craintif, très impressionable;
il bondit pour peu qu’on le touche; le moindre bruit le
fait tressaillir. Un certain bruit d’appel fait avec les
lèvres, ou un soufflet brusque imitant celui qu’emettent
les chats en colère excitent chez le rat une vive émotion.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>67. There are several well-authenticated cases on record
of children born without a vestige of brain, and others
with only a vestige, who nevertheless manifested the
ordinary signs of sensation. I will cite but one, and it
shall be one for which an illustrious physiologist, Panizza,
is the guarantee. A male infant, one of twins, who lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
but eighteen hours, during that period manifested such
unquestionable signs of Sensibility as the following: the
pupils contracted under light, sharp sounds caused flutterings,
and a bitter solution when placed in the mouth was
instantly rejected. This infant had not a vestige of cerebrum,
cerebellum, or cerebral ganglia. The medulla oblongata
was normal. There were no olfactory nerves, and
the optic nerves terminated in a little mass of membrane.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>68. The observations of Lussana and Lemoigne are
both extensive and precise, and the conclusion at which
they arrive is that the removal of the Cerebrum is the
abolition of Intelligence and Instinct, but is not the abolition
of Sensation. Whereas Rolando, and after him
Renzi, consider that only the Intelligence is abolished, the
supposed loss of Instinct being really nothing more than
the loss of the directive influence which makes the Instinct
to be executed.</p>

<p>69. Here it becomes needful to understand</p>

<h3 id="sec_34">THE MECHANISM OF INSTINCT.</h3>

<p>Were we dealing with an ordinary mechanism, and the
disturbances produced in its actions by the removal of any
part, we should attribute all observed effects to <i>interference
with the conditions of dependent sequence</i>: we should
infer that the actions were imperfectly performed, or
wholly abolished, because their requisite mechanical conditions
were disturbed. Let us be equally precise in dealing
with the physiological mechanism. If we have deprived
it of an organ in which certain combinations are
effected, we must expect to find all actions which were
dependent on such combinations to be now impossible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
but all the actions which are not directly dependent on
these combinations may still be possible. The actions of
feeding, for example, are determined by certain sensations,
when these are present in a particular sequence, but not
otherwise; the sensation of sight does not suffice, because
the animal must not only <i>see</i> the food, he must <i>perceive</i> it.
The action of defence and flight are also determined by
certain sensations, but only when these are connected in
a certain sequence: the brainless animal will defend itself,
or move out of the way, under the stimulus of unpleasant
sensation; but will not be moved by a <i>prospective</i> injury,
because he fails to associate it with the sight of the threatening
object. In the same way a blind man shrinks at
the actual contact of the heated poker, but does not shrink
at the approach of that poker which he does not see. We
do not deny him the possession of the so-called instinct
of Self-preservation on this ground; why deny it to the
brainless animal? The brainless fish or frog swims when
placed in the water, because the sensation from the <i>moving</i>
water<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> sets going the swimming mechanism. To call
this a “swimming instinct” may seem extravagant; yet
it is as fully entitled to the name as Self-defence is, or the
Alimentary Instinct. In all three cases there is a connate
mechanism set going by appropriate feelings.</p>

<p>70. Since all admit that there is an Alimentary Instinct,
let us see what kind of mechanism it implies.
There must be a state of feeling called Hunger, which—combined
with other feelings—determines certain muscular
adjustments in the search, recognition, capture, and
finally the swallowing of the food:—a very complex
series of actions, which lead to and sustain one another
until the desire is gratified. On the mental side there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
are three constituents, all indispensable: the hunger must
be felt, the food must be discriminated, the desire must
be gratified; on the physical side there are also the
indispensable arrangements of the motor mechanism.
Now it is obvious that the <i>entire</i> mechanism of this instinct
cannot be localized in the brain, even if its mental
elements are localized there; and there is reason to believe
that even the mental elements—the feelings of
hunger, discrimination, and gratification—are not exclusively
localized there. The brainless animal manifests if
not the feeling of Hunger, at any rate that feeling of discomfort
which is the basis of Hunger. The restlessness
is that of a hungry animal. Now we know that some of
the Systemic Sensibility is preserved, for we see the animal
breathing, swallowing, urinating, sleeping, preening
its feathers, changing its attitude, resting on one leg after
the fatigue of the other, etc. We may therefore infer that
other systemic sensations, such as Hunger and Thirst,
arise under the usual conditions.</p>

<p>71. We have noted an indication of Hunger; but on
further observation we discover that although the food is
eaten, if brought within reach of that portion of the feeding
mechanism which is still intact, yet the second step—the
feeling of recognition—is wanting. The animal
fails to perceive the food brought under his eyes, or even
placed in his mouth; unless the back part of the mouth
be touched, no swallowing takes place. Hence the animal
can no longer feed himself, and is therefore said to have
lost his instinct. But although the mechanism of the
instinct has been <i>disturbed</i>, its action is not wholly abolished.
The brain is necessary for that combination of
adjustments which normally accompany the perception
of food through sight and scent; and its absence of course
frustrates such combination; but we shall presently see
that although certain sensible marks by which a perception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
is guided are absent, others may still be present, and
suffice.</p>

<p>72. Before adducing examples let me say that we cannot
legitimately attribute the abeyance of an instinct
solely to the absence of the brain, 1°, because we observe
a similar abeyance of the instinct and frustration
of perception, even when the brain is present, and the
animal is in its normal state. 2°. On the other hand,
some instincts are unmistakably manifested, and some
perceptions excited, after the brain has been removed.
In fact, all that is needful is that some of the mental
elements of such perception and such instinct be preserved;
and this is the case so long as the leading
element is present.</p>

<p>73. On the first point consider this unequivocal example.
A healthy, hungry frog may be placed in a vessel
in which lie a quantity of dead flies. He sees these
flies, but sight is not enough; to him they are only so
many black spots, in which he does not recognize his
food, because the flies do not move, and the <i>leading
element</i> in his perception of food is not a <i>colored</i> form,
but a <i>moving</i> form. Hence this frog, in spite of brain and
an intact organism, will starve amidst appropriate food.
Whereas the frog that will not snap at motionless flies
snaps at any other small moving object, though it be not
his food. Goltz observed one incessantly snapping at the
moving tentacles of a slug which was in the vessel—as
if that were possible food! Not only the stupid frog, but
the more intelligent carnivora will starve in the presence
of appropriate food which is unrecognized, because the
leading element in the recognition is absent. The cat
will not eat a dead mouse, unless she has killed it herself.
Predatory animals must capture their food—unless the
scent of blood excites their alimentary instinct. So intimately
is this sensation of a moving object connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
with the predatory impulse, that the cat which is unexcited
by the dead mouse cannot resist springing on a
moving ball. We need not suppose the cat to mistake
this ball for food; but we must suppose that, accustomed
to pounce upon moving food, it is unable to resist the
impulse of this leading sensation.</p>

<p>74. The <i>presence</i> of the brain not sufficing, in the absence
of the leading sensation, we shall now see that the
<i>absence</i> of the brain will not prevent the execution of the
instinctive action, if the leading sensation be present.
The brainless bird sees a heap of grain, or a pan of
water, but no more recognizes them by sight alone than
the frog recognizes the dead flies; yet if the bird’s feet be
placed in the water, <i>this</i> sensation will suffice to make
him drink; if placed amid the grain, this sensation will
(sometimes) suffice to make him feed. Lussana and Lemoigne
state that their brainless pigeons ate and drank
with avidity when their feet were placed in grain and
water.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> M. Krishaber removed the hemispheres from a
pigeon, and observed that when his beak was thrust into
a heap of hempseed the head was quickly withdrawn,
whereas when the beak was plunged into water the bird
drank eagerly. Every day he was forced to feed the bird
by pouring the seed into its throat, but every day it
drank when the beak was thrust into the pan of water.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
Brücke noticed that his brainless hen, which made no
attempt to peck at the grain under her very eyes, began
pecking if the grain were thrown on the ground with
force, so as to produce a rattling sound. The sensation
of hearing was here more perfect than that of vision, and
sufficed to awaken the state of feeling necessary to initiate
the pecking movement.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
75. Somewhat analogous phenomena are observed in
Aphasia. The patient can see printed or written letters,
and even copy them; but he cannot read, i. e. interpret,
these symbols; as the birds see the grain, but cannot connect
this sensation with others. These letters and words,
which the patient cannot interpret when <i>seen</i>, he can interpret
when <i>heard</i>; he can not only understand them
when spoken, but write them if they are dictated to him.
The birds recognize the grain and water (or act as if they
did) when other sensations than those of sight are excited.
Sound is the leading element in Language, both
spoken and written. We hear the words even when we
see them, but we do not see them when we hear them.
The visible symbols are accessory and subordinate. But
to the born deaf the visible symbols dominate. How one
sensation will determine a particular group of movements
which cannot be effected by any other stimulus is abundantly
illustrated in disease no less than in experiment.
Here is a very luminous example: Gratiolet had a patient
for six months under his eye incapable of articulating a
single word, owing to the incoherence of her incessant utterance—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
babbled sounds, but could not group the
syllables into a recognizable word. Yet she could sing
the words of any song she knew, the musical sensations
being sufficient to guide her vocal organs. “Ainsi la
mémoire, infidèle dans le cas où les mots étaient des
idées, devenait claire et précise quand les mots étaient
des chansons.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>76. These illustrations plainly tell how the brainless
animal may starve amid his food, failing to perceive it
because the leading sensation is not excited; and how the
same animal may manifest his feeding instinct if the
mechanism be set going by a leading sensation. We are
told, indeed, that in the absence of the brain the actions
are mechanical reflexes from impressions, and not comparable
with the complex processes determined by perception.
I think, however, that the only difference is in
degree of complexity: a combination of touch, temperature,
and muscular movement will be simpler than one
which also combines sight, smell, and the revived images
of associated sensations. The sight of a sheep affects the
instinctive mechanism of a wolf <i>only</i> when combined
with the leading element of smell. Place a stuffed sheep
in a field, and no wolf will approach and spring on it,
whereas the blind wolf will find and capture the real
sheep; and I believe that were it practicable to remove
the brain without injury to the organ of scent and the
powers of locomotion, the wolf would track and capture
the living sheep.</p>

<p>77. The outcome of this discussion is that the mechanism
of each instinct is the adjustment of the organs which
effect the instinctive action; and this adjustment is not
simply a cerebral process, but a complex of <i>many</i> sensorial
processes; consequently the instinct cannot be exclusively
localized in the brain, although the cerebral process may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
be a very important element in the adjustment. This is
true even on the supposition that in speaking of Instinct
we refer only to the state of feeling which originates the
action—separating the psychological from the physiological
aspect of the phenomenon. For the brain <i>minus</i> the
organism is obviously incapable of feelings; whereas the
organism <i>minus</i> the brain is obviously capable of sensibilities
adequate to determine the actions. Thus the feeling
of hunger which prompts the alimentary actions does
not arise if the animal is satiated, nor does the sexual
feeling which prompts generative actions arise when the
animal is castrated; but each arises when the organism is
in a particular state. In vain will food be placed before
the satiated animal, or a female before the castrated male;
food and female are seen and recognized, but no desires
are excited, in spite of the brain and its supposed instincts.
On the contrary, when the brain is removed, the
need of the organism for food is felt, and this need determines
restless movements, which are directed by certain
other sensations, and the instinctive action of feeding is
finally effected; although, of course, the removal of the
brain has so disturbed the normal mechanism of the instinct
that the action is imperfect. Renzi says that an
animal deprived of its brain has lost the intelligence
which enables it to seek and seize its food, but not the
instinct, since it still has the desire for food. The following
experiment may illustrate this. Renzi wounded
superficially one optic thalamus of a frog without injuring
the external margin, or optic tract. The frog
showed no appreciable loss of sight, but hopped timidly
away whenever approached. Then both thalami were
divided transversely, the optic tract still being spared.
This frog remained motionless under every threat. It
manifested no alarm, and even when directly irritated,
only crawled or hopped away like a brainless frog. Sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
still so far remained that obstacles were avoided.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Now
since this animal’s brain was intact, and its organs of
movement were capable of responding to stimulation,
how are we to explain the loss of its instinct of self-preservation?
The frog perceived no danger in a threatening
approach, yet perceived an obstacle and avoided it,
getting under it if there were room enough, crawling beside
it if that was the easier escape. Why did one vision
prompt the movements of escape, and another fail? Was
it not that in the one case the normal pathway was still
open, in the other closed? We know that one injury
will destroy the perception of color without destroying
that of light and shadow; so one injury may destroy the
combination of neural processes necessary for the perception
of a <i>danger</i>, without destroying those necessary for
the perception of a <i>hindrance</i>. If all actions depend
on their mechanical conditions, they must be disturbed
according to the disturbance of the conditions. Nothnagel
found that after removing the <i>nucleus lentiformis</i> on
both sides of a rabbit, leaving all the rest of the encephalon
intact, the rabbit hopped when its tail was pinched;
yet although starting at the sound when hands were
loudly clapped, did not hop as a normal rabbit does; nor
although closing his eyes when a light was brought near
them, did he ever move aside. No feeling of danger was
excited by sound or sight. In striking contrast are the
phenomena manifested by a rabbit whose <i>corpora striata</i>
have been removed: it is with difficulty made to hop by
pinching its skin, whereas noises and sights cause it to
make terrified bounds.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
78. No sooner do we analyze the conditions of an instinct
than we see the error of regarding instincts as localized
in the brain. The cerebral process is only one factor
in the product—an important factor, no doubt, since the
cerebrum is the supreme centre of incitation and regulation;
but its absence does not wholly carry away the
activity of the mechanism, sentient and motor, on which
the instincts depend, it only carries away one source of
stimulation and regulation.</p>

<p>79. An instinct depends on a connate mechanism. Let
us glance for a moment at a parallel case of an ordinary
reflex action, also dependent on a connate mechanism, say
that of sneezing. When the inner surface of the nose is
stimulated by snuff, or other irritant, the nasal branch of
the trigeminus is excited, and the effects are first a deep
inspiration, then a closure of the respiratory orifices by
the tongue, which in turn excites a spasmodic expiration.
But the same effects are producible from quite different
stimulations—namely, that of the ciliary nerves on sudden
exposure to a glare of sunshine—or of the skin
nerves on a sudden draught of cold air. Brücke remarks
that there is perhaps no spot on the surface of
the body from which this reflex may not be excited in
very sensitive people. He knew a gentleman who always
sneezed when in winter he laid hold of a cold door-bell;
and the fit of sneezing was only arrested by giving him a
crust of bread or something hard to gnaw. Now just as
the connate mechanism of sneezing may be set in action
by a variety of stimulations, so may the connate mechanism
of an instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_35">ACQUISITION.</h3>

<p>80. Not only may Discrimination and Instinct be manifested
in the absence of the brain, but even the acquisition
of new modes of reaction, such as are classed under
Learning through Experience. The objection is sometimes
urged that animals without their brains only manifest
single reactions on stimulation—the pinched foot
is withdrawn, and then remains motionless until again
pinched. But although the stimulation does not excite
a consecutive series of movements, because there is no
cerebrum to react in successive stimulation, this does not
prove the absence of sensation in the one movement
which is excited. If my hand be lying on the table, and
something irritates it, my hand is withdrawn, and then
remains as motionless as the limb of the brainless animal,
<i>until</i> some fresh stimulation, external or internal, moves
it. Although removal of the brain causes a manifest reduction
in the variety and succession of the movements,
all experimenters are agreed that animals acquire a certain
dexterity in executing actions which they had previously
failed to carry out after removal of their brains.
“There is,” says Freusberg, “a decided improvement acquired
in the reactions of the motor centres after division
of the spinal cord, not indeed in vigor, but in delicacy.
Removed from the regulating influence of the brain, the
legs acquired through practice a power of self-regulation.”
Nor is this wonderful: pathways are made easy by repetition
of impulses, and new adaptations form new adjustments.
It is thus all learning is effected—intelligent,
and automatic. Nor is there any force in the objection
that the power thus acquired speedily disappears, so that
if the stimulations are effected at long intervals the reactions
do not manifest their acquired dexterity. The spinal
centres forget, as the cerebral centres forget; but they also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
remember, i. e. they learn. Because an animal shows to-day
none of the aptitude it acquired three days ago, we
are not to deny that it had once acquired the aptitude
it has now lost. Attempt to teach a child to read by
giving it spelling lessons of two or three minutes at intervals
of two or three months, and little will the acquisition
be!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>81. Hitherto we have been considering phenomena
manifested in the absence of the cerebral hemispheres,
because it is in these that the majority of writers place
the sensorium. There are, indeed, many authoritative
writers who regard the ganglionic masses at the base of
the cerebrum, and even those of the medulla oblongata, as
participating in this sensorial property, which they refuse
to the lower ganglia in the spinal cord. I cannot follow
their logic. The cerebrum is by its position as a centre
of centres, and its detachment from all direct innervation
of organs, so different from the rest of the neural axis,
that we can understand how it should be assigned a
special function; although being of the same tissue as
the other ganglionic masses, it must have the same property.
And what that special function is I shall hereafter
endeavor to set forth. But that the upper region of the
spinal axis should differ so profoundly from the lower
region as to be the seat of psychical processes, while the
lower region is simply the seat of mechanical processes,
is what I cannot understand, so long as the anatomical
structure and physiological properties of the two regions
are seen to be identical. The various centres innervate
various organs, and have consequently various functions.
As each centre is removed, we observe a corresponding
loss of function—the organism is truncated, but continues
to manifest such functions as have still their
mechanisms intact. Let us suppose the brain or upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
regions of the cord detached from the lower regions by a
section of the cord; the animal will still live, and perform
almost all its functions in the normal way, but there
will be little or no consensus between the lower and the
upper regions. Granting Sensibility to both, we must
still see that the sensation excited in one will not be felt
in the other. And this is the ground on which physiologists
deny that the lower regions have Sensibility. Without
pausing here to examine this point, which will occupy
us in the next chapter, I assume that the positive evidence
of Sensibility suffices to discredit that argument;
and in furtherance of that assumption will cite an example
of sensation and volition manifested by the lower
portion of the cord when separated from the brain and
upper portion.</p>

<p>82. The function of Urination is one which notoriously
belongs to the voluntary class, in so far as it is
initiated or arrested by a voluntary impulse, and it is one
which, according to the classic teaching, has its centre in
the brain. The grounds on which this cerebral centre is
assigned are very similar to those on which other functions
are assigned to cerebral centres, namely, observation
of the suppression of the function when the pathway
between certain organs and the brain is interrupted.
But the careful experiments of Goltz<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> have demonstrated
that the “centre” of Urination is not in the brain, but
in the lower region of the cord. When the cord is completely
divided, Urination is performed in the <i>normal</i>
way—not passively, not irregularly, but with all the
characters of the active regular function. And, what is
also noticeable, this function is so intimately dependent
on Sensibility that it will be arrested—like any other
function—by a sensation excited from the periphery—to
be resumed when the irritation ceases. Now this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
arrest from a stimulation of sensory nerves takes place
when the brain is cut off from the spinal centre, just as
when the brain is in connection with it.</p>

<p>The same is true of Defecation, and the still more
complex functions of Generation and Parturition. I can
only refer the reader to the very remarkable case of
Goltz’s bitch with the spinal cord divided in the lumbar
region, if evidence be wanted for the performance of
complex functions so long as the spinal centres were intact.
It is true that Goltz considers these functions to have
been independent of <i>sensation</i>; but that is because he
has not entirely emancipated himself from the traditional
views; for my purpose it is enough that he admits the
functions to be dependent on sensorial processes.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>83. To sum up the evidence, we may say that observation
discloses a surprising resemblance in the manifestations
of the cord and brain. In both there are reflex processes,
and processes of arrest; in both there are actions
referable to conscious and unconscious processes; in both
depression and exaltation are produced by the same drugs;
in both there are manifestations interpretable, as those
of Discrimination, Logic, Instinct, Volition, Acquisition,
Memory; in both there is manifestation of Sensibility—how
then can we deny Sensation to the one if we accord
it to the other?</p>

<span class="subhead">NEGATIVE INDUCTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>84. <span class="firstword">I fancy</span> some reader exclaiming: “All your reasoning,
and all your marshalled facts, are swept away by
the irresistible evidence of human patients with injured
spinal cords, whose legs have manifested reflex actions,
and who nevertheless declared they had <i>no sensation
whatever</i> in them. We can never be sure of what passes
in an animal; but man can tell us whether he feels an
impression, or does not feel it; and since he tells us that
he does not feel it, <i>cannot</i>, however he may <i>try</i>, we
conclude that reflex action may take place without
sensation.”</p>

<p>As this is the one solitary fact which is held to negative
the mass of evidence, anatomical and physiological,
in favor of the Sensibility of the spinal cord, it is necessary
that we should candidly examine it. No reader will
suppose that during the twenty years in which I have
advocated the doctrine expounded in this volume, I have
not been fully alive to the one fact which prevented the
general acceptance of the doctrine. From the first it has
seemed to me that the fact has been misinterpreted.</p>

<p>85. Certain injuries to the spinal cord destroy the
connection of the parts below the injury with the parts
above it; consequently no impression made on the limbs
below the injured spot is transmitted to the brain, nor
can any cerebral incitation reach those limbs. The
patient has lost all consciousness of these limbs, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
control over them. Hunter’s patient on being asked if he
felt any pain when the prick caused his leg to kick,
answered, “No: but you see my leg does.” This answer
has been regarded as a drollery; I think it expressed a
physiological truth. For on the assumption that the
whole of the cerebro-spinal axis had one uniform <i>property</i>,
corresponding with its uniform structure, and various
<i>functions</i>, corresponding with the variety of organs
it innervates, a division of this axis would necessarily
create two independent seats of Sensibility, and interrupt
the consensus of their functions. In such a case it
would be absurd to expect that the cerebral segment
could be affected by, or co-operate with, what affected the
spinal segment.</p>

<p>Now, when a man has a diseased spinal cord, the seat
of injury causes, for the time at least, a division of the
whole group of centres into two independent groups.
For all purposes of sensation and volition it is the same
as if he were cut in half; his nervous mechanism <i>is</i> cut
in half. How then can any cerebral control be obeyed
by his legs; how can any impression on his legs be felt
by his cerebrum? As well might we expect the man
whose arm has been amputated, to feel the incisions of
the scalpel, when that limb is conveyed to the dissecting-table,
as to feel by his brain impressions made upon parts
wholly divorced from organic connection with the brain.</p>

<p>86. But, it may be objected, this is the very point
urged. The man himself does not feel the impressions
on his legs when his spine has been injured; he is as
insensible to them as to the dissection of his amputated
arm. Very true. <i>He</i> does not feel it. But if the
amputated arm were to strike the anatomist who began
its dissection, if its fingers were to grasp the scalpel, and
push it away, or with the thumb to rub off the acid
irritating one of the fingers, I do not see how we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
refuse to admit that the <i>arm</i> felt although the <i>man</i> did
not. And this is the case with the extremities of a man
whose spine is injured. <i>They</i> manifest every indication
of sensibility. In the frog and pigeon the legs manifest
the unmistakable control which we ascribe to volition.
It is true that the man himself, when interrogated,
declares that he feels nothing; the cerebral segment has
attached to it organs of speech and expressive features,
by which <i>its</i> sensations can be communicated to others;
whereas the spinal segment has <i>no</i> such means of communicating
<i>its</i> sensations; but those which it <i>has</i>, it
<i>employs</i>. You can ask the cerebral segment a question,
which can be heard, understood, and answered; this is
not the case with the spinal segment: yet if you <i>test</i> its
sensibility, the result is unequivocal. You cannot ask
an animal whether it feels, but you can test its sensibility,
and that test suffices.</p>

<p>87. The question we have to decide, therefore, is not
whether a patient, with an injured spine, can feel impressions
on, or convey voluntary impulses to, limbs below
the seat of injury—for as respects the nervous
mechanism these limbs are separated from him, no less
than if actual amputation had taken place—the question
is, whether these separated limbs have any sensibility?
And the answer seems to me unequivocally affirmative.
I assert, therefore, that if there is ample evidence to show
that the spinal centres have sensibility, when separated
from the cerebral centres, such evidence can in no respect
be weakened by the fact that a man with an injured
spine is unconscious of impressions made below
the seat of injury; since such a fact necessarily follows
from the establishment of two centres: the parts above
are then not sensitive to impressions on the parts below;
nor are the parts below sensitive to impressions on the
parts above; but each segment is sensitive to its own
affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
88. Every one knows that there are animals, low down
in the scale, which may be cut in two, each half continuing
to live, and each capable of reproducing its lost
segments. Would any one, seeing these separated halves
move and manifest ordinary signs of sensibility, venture
to say that the one half was a living, the other an insentient,
mechanism? And since the one half had eyes,
mouth, tentacles, etc., while the other half had none of
these, would the observer be surprised that the functions
of the one differed from those of the other in these respects?
Why, then, should he not conclude the same of
the two halves of the human mechanism, when disease
had divided them?</p>

<p>89. The man, you urge, does not feel the prick on his
leg. This is true, because “the man” here designates
the seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, talking, thinking
group of organs—to the exclusion of the limb or limbs
which are no longer in sensitive connection with this
group. When a leg is amputated “the man” remains—a
truncated man, indeed, yet still one having all the distinguishing
human characters. Yet obviously in strict
language we can no longer say that the man is the <i>same</i> as
he was. “Man” or “animal” means the complex whole;
and each anatomically separable part forms one constituent
of that whole. The medulla oblongata and spinal
cord innervate certain parts; the mesencephalon innervates
others; the cerebrum rises above the whole. If
after removing one limb, then another, we continued
truncating the organism till we left only the head, should
we call <i>that</i> the man? Clearly not. Should we even
suppose that the intact brain—the supposed seat of sensation
and volition—still felt, and willed? Clearly not.
There is absolutely no evidence, however faint, of the
isolated head manifesting any sensational and volitional
phenomena; whereas there is ample evidence of the truncated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
spinal cord manifesting some of these phenomena.
And this is intelligible when we understand that the
nerve-centres stimulate into action the organs they innervate,
but do not by themselves play any other part.</p>

<p>90. “The man” then does not feel the prick on his
leg, but his leg feels it. The man has no consciousness
of what takes place outside the sphere of his sensitive
mechanism; and the leg is now outside that sphere.
Consciousness—as distinguished from Sentience in general—we
have seen to be a resultant of the composition
of forces co-operating at the moment; the Sensibility of
the spinal cord in the regions below the injury cannot
<i>now</i> enter into that composition. It is detached from the
upper organs. But inasmuch as the organs it innervates
are still living and active, the functions of this detached
portion are still displayed. We have seen the dog with
divided cord capable of Urination, Defecation, Generation,
etc.; its hinder legs, though not moving in a consensus
with the forelegs, yet moved independently; and all the
normal reflexes of the parts followed on stimulations.
To say that “the dog” showed no signs of Sensibility
when its hinder limbs were irritated, is identifying “the
dog” with the anterior half of the organism which was
not in connection with the posterior half. It is equally
true that the posterior half showed no signs of Sensibility
when the anterior was irritated. The two halves were
united by the circulation, nutrition, etc., but disunited as
to sensation and volition.</p>

<p>91. Do I then suppose the separated half of an animal
to feel pain and pleasure, hope and terror? The reader
who has attentively followed the exposition will be at no
loss to answer. Pain, pleasure, hope, and terror, are
special modes of Sensibility, dependent on particular
neural combinations. The organs comprised in the anterior
half of the animal furnish the main conditions for
these special modes, whereas the organs comprised in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
posterior half furnish few or none of those—they contain
none of the special Senses, and they are without the
chief combining centre, the brain. But since we know
that a large amount of normal Sensation is wholly without
the special characters of pain, pleasure, hope, or terror,
we need not hesitate to assign Sensation to the spinal
cord because these characters are absent.</p>

<p>92. All I contend for is that the spinal centres have
Sensibility of the same <i>order</i> as the cerebral centres; and
that in the normal organism this Sensibility enters as a
factor into the general Consciousness—no one portion
of the nervous system being really independent of all the
others, all co-operating in every result. Over and over
again I have had to insist that the property of Sensibility
is only the general condition of Sensation; and that each
particular sensation receives its <i>character</i> from the organs
innervated, <i>plus</i> the reaction of the whole organism. Obviously,
therefore, the peculiar character of a sensation, or
“state of consciousness,” must vary with the variations
in either of these factors. To say that every segment of
the spinal cord has Sensibility, is not saying that an excitation
of that segment will produce a particular sensation
of definite character; because for this definite character
there is needed the co-operation of all those parts
of the mechanism which enter into the complex product.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>93. And here attention must be called to a double
fallacy pervading the arguments on the other side. It is
always assumed that the reactions of an organ, or part of
the organism, when separated from the rest, are typical
of their reactions when forming constituents of the normal
organism. Nothing of the kind. The movement of
a muscle or a limb separated from the body may resemble
that movement when normally effected—but only as the
movements of a mechanical bird resemble those of a living
bird: the modes of production are different. So that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
were we to grant the postulate of the brain being the exclusive
seat of sensation, we should still deny that an
action which was effected after removal of the brain was
typical of the action effected when the brain was present.
The leg of Hunter’s patient jerked when the skin was
irritated; but this action could not be altogether the
same as the similar action in a leg united with the rest
of the sensitive mechanism. Nor is this all. The leg
may have been insensible, the spinal segment which innervated
it may have been wholly without Sensibility,
and still we should have to question the logic which extended
such an inference to the very different and far
more complex actions of decapitated animals. On this
ground:—The leg is, by the hypothesis, insensible because
cut off from all connection with the sensitive
mechanism. But this is not the case with the decapitated
animal: there still remain the essential parts of a
sensitive mechanism—all the chief organs are still in
activity, still manifesting their functions. Decapitation
has produced a great disturbance in the mechanism, and
has removed an important centre; but nevertheless every
impression excites a connected group of centres, and this
group responds.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>94. In conclusion, unless we adopt the opinion that
Sensation—Consciousness—Sensibility, is something
not belonging to the physiological properties of the nervous
system in a vital organism (the opinion held by
spiritualists), there seems no alternative but to adopt the
opinion advocated in this volume, namely, that the physiological
properties of the nervous system are inseparable
from every segment of that system; and the functions
are the manifestation of those properties as determined
by the special organs with the co-operation of all.</p>

1871, p. 5, gives a remarkable illustration of what may be called the
frustration of chemical affinity effected by mechanical conditions. “Before
calico can be printed, every loose particle of cotton must be removed
from the surface in order that the colored inks may not run. This removal
is effected by passing the calico over and in contact with a red-hot
iron cylinder, and by regulating the rapidity with which the cylinder revolves,
the intense heat burns off the loose fibres, yet does no injury to
the woven cloth. In other words, the changes in the relation of the high
temperature and the cotton are too rapid to admit of the fibre combining
with the oxygen. Let the rate of revolution be reduced but very little,
and the calico would burst into flames.” Any one who has snuffed a
candle with his fingers will understand this. Dr. Madden further instances
certain fulminates which can be detonated in contact with gun-cotton
without causing it to explode—the extreme rapidity with which
the fulminates expand is too great to enable the gun-cotton to adjust its
movements to this new motion. Precisely the same kind of thing occurs
in organized matter. If the rate of its changes be reduced below a certain
point, the ordinary chemical affinities will assert themselves.</p></div>

fifty-seven hours, although other embryos placed in a similar watch-glass

in the gnat become developed into the respiratory apparatus. The

“Natura non facit saltum” may be perfectly true; but without impugning
the Law of Continuity we may urge that the Law of Discontinuity
is equally true. The one is an abstract ideal conception; the other is a
concrete ideal conception. According to the one, every change from rest
to motion, or from one state to another, must pass through infinites; according
to the other every change is abrupt. In my First Series, Vol. I.
p. 327, I have shown how, on mechanical principles, every change in an
organism must be abrupt. A glance at the metamorphoses of the embryo,
or the stages of insect-development, will show very sudden and
abrupt changes. Let me also cite Mr. Darwin against himself: “When
we remember such cases as the formation of the more complex galls, and
certain monstrosities, which cannot be accounted for by reversion, cohesion,
etc., and <i>sudden, strongly marked deviations of structure</i>, such as
the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose, we must admit that the
organization of the individual is capable through <i>its own laws of growth,
under certain conditions</i>, of undergoing great modifications, independent
of the gradual accumulation of slight inherited modifications.”—<i>Origin</i>,

genus of large dimensions, with an extra abdominal segment, and a
different tail; a genus, moreover, which is propagated sexually, whereas

The exceeding importance of this fact is, that it proves specific and
even generic differences to originate simply through the gradual changes
of the medium and the adaptation of the organism to these new conditions.
It also disproves the very common notion—adopted even by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Darwin</span> himself—that “organic beings must be exposed <i>during several

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> In 1859 I mentioned that if the nerves of a frog’s back be exposed by
raising the skin, they may be pricked or even cut without sensible effect,
although a slight prick on the skin will excite the nerves, and cause
a reflex action. In 1870, Prof. <span class="smcap">Fick</span> expressed his astonishment at
finding that after he had cut out a piece of the skin, leaving it attached
to the body by a single nerve, electrical stimulation of this excised skin
caused the frog to make the reflex movement of rubbing the irritated surface;
whereas electrical stimulation of the nerve-trunk itself produced no
reflex effect, only a twitching of a muscle. <i>Pflüger’s Archiv</i>, 1870, p.
327. <span class="smcap">Brown Séquard</span> tries to establish a distinct species of nerves
as <i>conductors</i> of sensitive impressions, from those which are <i>impressionable</i>.
The facts on which he founds these two properties simply show
that nerves are so disposed that the stimulus which excites them in
one place fails in another. He could hardly maintain that a skin
nerve contained impressionable fibres at its periphery, and only conducting
fibres in its trunk! See his communication to the Royal Society,
<i>Proceedings</i>, 1856; and <i>Lectures</i> in the <i>Lancet</i>, 10th July, 1858.</p></div>

unless the thalami and the connected tracts are at the same time in
action. I go further, and maintain that there is no Consciousness (in

Cerebral or spinal activity will be activity of Sensibility; but this is only
the basis of Consciousness.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> By selective adaptation is meant the varying combination of motor
impulses to suit the varying requirements of the effect to be produced.
Physical mechanisms are limited to the performance of definite actions;
sensitive mechanisms employ fluctuating combinations of elements in
response to fluctuations of stimuli. The wheels, levers, springs, and
valves of a machine cannot be differently combined according to varying
degrees of the motor-force, as the nerves and muscles of an organism are
differently combined by varying sensations. An automaton may be constructed
to play on the violin, but it will only play the air to which it is
<i>set</i>; it cannot vary the performance,—cannot play a false note, or throw
in a <i>crescendo</i> here, a <i>largo</i> there, according to a caprice of feeling. We
must admit that violinist has his delicate and changing movements
guided by sensations, auditory and muscular; any interruption in the
sensations would arrest the movements, which in truth <i>incorporate</i> them.
And yet it is well known that the violinist may perform while completely
“unconscious.” I do not simply refer to the fact that his thoughts and
attention may be elsewhere; I refer to such facts as are recorded in
Pathology. <span class="smcap">Trousseau</span>, for example, had an epileptic patient who was
occasionally seized with attacks of complete unconsciousness while he was
performing in the orchestra; yet, on reawakening to consciousness, he
found that he had continued to play, had kept proper time, and played
the proper notes.</p></div>

showed that not only were the muscles of the iris directly stimulated by
light (and this not by its calorific or chemical rays), but that sixteen days
after removal of the eye from the orbit, this effect was observable in the

</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Donders</span> has the following observations: “The movements of the iris
are of two kinds—reflex and voluntary. Reflex action is exhibited as
constriction of the pupil in consequence of the stimulus of incident light
upon the retina. Fontana has shown that the light falling upon the iris
produces no remarkable contraction. We have confirmed this result by
causing the image of a small distant light to fall, by means of a convex
lens, upon the iris, whereby, during slight perception of light, a doubtful
contraction occurred, which gave way to a strong contraction so soon as
the light entering the pupil excited a vivid perception. Nevertheless, the
experiments of Harless and Budge have shown that even after death, so
long as irritability remains, the pupil still contracts upon the continued
action of light. Of the correctness of this we have satisfied ourselves.
In a dog killed by loss of blood the one eye was closed, the other opened
and turned to the light: after the lapse of an hour, the pupil of the
opened eye was perceptibly smaller than that of the closed eye. The latter
now remained also exposed to the light, and on the following day the
diameter of both eyes was equal. The upper jaw, alone with the eyes,
was taken out of some frogs; one eye was exposed to the light, while the
other was covered with a closely folded piece of black paper: after
the lapse of half an hour the pupil turned to the light was narrow, the
other wide. But the latter also contracted almost immediately after the
removal of the paper.”—<span class="smcap">Donders</span>, <i>On the Anomalies of Accommodation

The nerve when divided rapidly undergoes fatty degeneration, which is

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Strong confirmation of various statements in the text, since they
were written, has been furnished by the researches of <span class="smcap">Eichhorst</span>, published
in <i>Virchow’s Archiv</i>, LXIV. Our knowledge of the development
of nerve-tissue in human embryos is so scanty that these researches have
a great value. <span class="smcap">Eichhorst</span> describes the striation of the cells in the cord
to begin only at the fourth month; up to this time they are, what I find
most invertebrate cells to be, granular, not fibrillar. There is very slight
branching of the cell processes until the ninth or tenth month, when the
multipolar aspect first appears; the cells are unipolar up to the end of
the fourth month. The connection between the white columns and the
gray columns is very loose up to the fifth month; and the two are easily
separated. Subsequently the union is closer. The substance of the white
columns readily separates into bundles and fibres, but that of the gray
columns falls into a granular detritus if attempted to be teased out with
needles. But after the fifth month this is no longer so. Instead of a
granular detritus there appears a network of fine fibres and fibrils. Although
the white posterior columns are developed before the fifth month,
not a single cell can be seen in the posterior gray columns until the
second half of the ninth month. (Yet the fibres are imagined to arise in
the cells!) The passage from the granular to the fibrillar state is the
same in the cell substance and the neuroglia. The nerve-fibre, as distinguished
from a naked axis cylinder, does not appear till the fourth month.
It is at first a bipolar prolongation of the nucleus. As it elongates, the
nucleus seems to sit <i>on</i> it, and so loosely that it is easily shifted away by
pressure on the covering glass. Finally the fibre separates entirely from
the nucleus, and <i>then</i> begins to clothe itself with the medullary sheath.
Very curious is the observation that so long as the axis cylinder is naked
it is never varicose, but with the development of the medulla the primitive
axis becomes fluid.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The mode of termination of nerves in muscles is still a point on
which histologists disagree; probably because there is no abrupt termination,
but a blending of the one tissue with the other. In the Tardigrades,
for example, there is actually no appreciable distinction between
nerve and muscle at the point of insertion of the nerve; and if in the
higher animals there is an appreciable difference between nerve and muscle,
there is an inseparable blending of undifferentiated substance at their
point of junction. [According to <span class="smcap">Engelmann’s</span> recent researches, there
seems good reason to suppose that muscles are composed of contractile
substance and a substance which is a modification of axis-cylinder substance;
the first being doubly refracting, the second isotropic: <i>Pflüger’s

l’appareil avec le plus grand soin, par fractions de centimètres, par <i>millimètres</i>

battements du cœur et qui produit le maximum de pulsations dans l’unité
de temps admise pour l’expérience. Quand on est là il suffit <i>d’un millimètre</i>
de plus pour faire disparaître l’augmentation, un autre millimètre
peut produire une diminution, et un <i>troisième</i> peut arrêter le cœur complètement.

movement of the eye is to be considered voluntary. It is true
we contract the pupil without being conscious of the contraction of muscular
fibres, <i>but this holds good for every voluntary movement</i>. When a
person raises the tone of his voice he is not conscious that by muscular
contraction he makes his chordæ vocales more tense; he attains his object
without being aware of the means by which he does so. The same
is applicable to accommodation for near objects and to the contraction of
the pupil accompanying it. The fact that <i>this last is only an associated
movement does not deprive it of its voluntary character</i>, for there is perhaps
no single muscle which can contract entirely by itself.” <span class="smcap">Donders</span>,

the pupil dilates, when of a very bright spot the pupil contracts. (<span class="smcap">Noble</span>,
<i>The Human Mind</i>, 1858, p. 124.) I believe this to be only an
exaggerated form of the normal tendency. In all of us the mechanism
is so disposed that the feelings of dilatation are associated with feelings
(and consequently ideas) of darkness; and by this association a reversal
of the process obtains, so that the idea of darkness calls up the feeling it
symbolizes.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> <span class="smcap">Descartes</span> compares the animal mechanism to that of the grottos
and fountains at Versailles, the nerves to the water-tubes:—“Les objets
extérieurs qui par leur seul présence, agissent contre les organes des sens,
et qui par ce moyen, la déterminent à se mouvoir en plusieurs diverses
façons, selon comme les parties du cerveau sont disposées, sont comme les
étrangers, qui entrant dans quelques unes des grottes de ces fontaines
causent euxmêmes sans y penser les mouvements qui s’y font en leur
présence: car ils n’y peuvent entrer qu’en marchant sur certains carreaux
tellement disposés, que s’ils approchent d’une Diane qui se baigne, ils la
font cacher dans les roseaux; et s’ils passent outre pour la poursuivre, ils
feront venir vers eux un Neptune qui les menacera de son trident; ou s’ils
vont de quelque autre costé, ils en feront sortir un monstre marin qui leur
vomira de l’eau contre la face.”—<i>Traité de l’Homme</i>, 1664, p. 12. Ingenious
as the comparison is, it only illustrates how machines may be
constructed to imitate animal actions. Diana always hides herself when
a certain spot is trodden upon; and Neptune always appears when another
spot is trodden upon. There is no fluctuation, no sensibility discerning
differences and determining variations. Compare the following
experiment: A monkey was placed on the table and a shrill whistle made
close to its ear: “Immediately the ear was pricked and the animal turned
with an air of intense surprise, with eyes widely opened and pupils
dilated, to the direction whence the sound proceeded. On repetition of
the experiment several times, though the pricking of the ear and the
turning of the head and eyes constantly occurred, the look of surprise
and dilatation of the pupils ceased to be manifested.”—<span class="smcap">Ferrier</span>,
<i>The Functions of the Brain</i>, 1876, p. 171. A mechanical monkey would
always have reacted in precisely the same way on each stimulus.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_243" href="#FNanchor_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> The idea of a <i>fixed anatomical mechanism</i> for reflexion, such as that
of an excito-motory system, is completely refuted by the fact that the gray
substance may anywhere be cut sway, and yet so long as a small bridge
of gray substance remains the stimulation will be propagated through it.
The idea of a <i>fixed pathway</i> is also refuted by the fact of the variations
in the reflex responses, and the necessary irradiation even for very simple
reflexes. Take, for example, that of breathing. An irritation of the
bronchial filaments is transmitted by the pneumogastric to its centre in
the medulla oblongata; from this, however, it is immediately irradiated
<i>downwards</i> to the cervical and dorsal regions, which innervate the
muscles of chest and diaphragm, and <i>upwards</i> to the brain, whether the
stimulation awaken consciousness or not. One may say, indeed, that
inasmuch as under normal conditions the bronchial irritation always
causes a movement of a particular group of muscles, there is to this extent
a fixed pathway of discharge; but, as I have formerly explained, this
is only an expression of the particular tension of particular centres, and
is variable with that tension; the other centres are also affected, even
when they are not excited to discharge.</p></div>

the cerebral hemispheres, because it is in these that sensation, volition,
and consciousness are localized by the generality of writers, many of
whom, indeed, regard the cells of the gray matter of the convolutions as
the exclusive seat of these phenomena, dividing these cells into sensational,
emotional, and intellectual. There are physiologists who extend
sensation to the cerebral ganglia and gray masses of the medulla oblongata;
but the medulla spinalis is so clearly continuous with the medulla
oblongata that there is a glaring inconsistency in excluding sensation from
the one if it is accorded to the other; and the grounds on which sensitive
phenomena are admitted in the absence of the hemispheres, force us
to admit analogous phenomena in the absence of the ganglia and medulla
oblongata: in each case the phenomena are less complex and varied as
the mechanisms become less complex.</p></div>

in the text: A dog deprived of a portion of both hemispheres displayed
a marked imperfection in the execution of ordinary instincts. Although
sight was impaired he could see, and recognize men and certain objects:
the sight of a whip made him cower, but the sight of meat did not suffice
to set the feeding mechanism in action. When meat was suspended
above his head, the scent caused him to sniff about in search, but he
failed to find it, and even when he was so placed that he could see the
suspended meat, the <i>unusual</i> impression failed to guide him. If the
meat were held towards him, or placed before him in a dish, he took it
at once—this being the customary stimulation. So also, if the hand
were held up, in the usual way when dogs are made to leap for food, this
dog sprang vigorously up and caught the food; but he would spring up
in the same way when the hand was held empty, and continue fruitlessly
springing, whereas an uninjured dog ceases to spring when he sees the
hand is empty.—<i>Pflüger’s Archiv</i>, Bd. XIV. p. 419.</p></div>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
